A long time ago, I wrote a [useful set of git aliases](https://haacked.com/archive/2014/07/28/github-flow-aliases/) to support the GitHub flow. My favorite alias was `bdone` which would:

1. Checkout the default branch.
2. Run `git up` to make sure you're up to date.
3. Run `git bclean` to delete all the branches that have been merged into the default branch.

And this worked great for a long time. The way it worked was it would list all the branches that have been merged into the default branch and then delete them. In my case, I didn't use `git branch --merged` to list merged branches because I didn't know about it at the time.

However, my aliases stopped working for me recently after joining PostHog. The main reason is on pretty much all of their repositories, they use Squash and Merge when merging PRs.

When you use `git merge --squash` or GitHub's "Squash and merge" feature, Git creates a new commit on the target branch that combines all the changes from the source branch into a single commit. This new commit doesn't retain any reference to the original commits from the source branch. As a result, Git doesn't consider the source branch as merged, and commands like `git branch --merged` won't show it.

But here's the thing about Git. There's almost always a way.

## Solution

When you merge a PR on GitHub, it shows you a "Delete branch" button:

This is a great feature. It's a good way to clean up branches that have been merged into the default branch. In fact, you can configure GitHub to "Automatically delete head branches" when merged:

I highly recommend you do the same. When the remote branch is deleted, Git will track it as "gone". For example, if you run `git branch -vv` you'll see something like this:

```bash
> git branch -vv

  haacked/decide-v4      ba39408 [origin/haacked/decide-v4: gone] Fix demo to handle variants
  haacked/fix-sample-app ec15751 [origin/haacked/fix-sample-app] Handle variants
* haacked/local-only     e78d2f6 Do important stuff
  main                   ab885d0 [origin/main] chore: Bump to v1.0.2
```

Notice that `haacked/decide-v4` is marked as `gone`.

We can use git's porcelain to list branches and their tracking information in a more easily parseable format.

```bash
> git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads/

haacked/decide-v4 [gone]
haacked/fix-sample-app
haacked/local-only
master
```

Let's make this an alias to list these gone branches:

```bash
> git config --global alias.gone "!git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads/ | awk '\$2 == \"[gone]\" { print \$1 }'"
```

Now we can use the alias to list gone branches:

```bash
> git gone

haacked/decide-v4
```

Next step is to update my old `bclean` alias to use the new `gone` alias.

```bash
> git config --global alias.bclean "!git gone | xargs -r git branch -D"
```

Unfortunately, since git doesn't know it's been merged, we have to do a force delete. That's a bit scary, but this won't touch local branches or any branches that are still tracking a remote branch. With this alias, you can run `git bclean` to delete all the branches that have been merged into the default branch. Finally, we have the old `bdone` alias to switch to the default branch, run `git up`, and then run `bclean`.

Here's the complete set of aliases mentioned in this post you can cut and paste into your `.gitconfig`:

```ini
[alias]
    default = "!git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'"
    bclean = "!git gone | xargs -r git branch -D"
    # Switches to specified branch (or the default branch if no branch is specified), runs git up, then runs bclean.
    bdone = "!f() { DEFAULT=$(git default); git checkout ${1-$DEFAULT} && git up && git bclean; }; f"
    gone = "!git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads/ | awk '$2 == \"[gone]\" { print $1 }'"
```

Or, if you want to use the `git` command line, you can use the following:

```bash
git config --global alias.default "!git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'"
git config --global alias.gone "!git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads/ | awk '\$2 == \"[gone]\" { print \$1 }'"
git config --global alias.bclean "!git gone | xargs -r git branch -D"
git config --global alias.bdone "!f() { DEFAULT=\$(git default); git checkout \${1:-\$DEFAULT} && git up && git bclean; }; f"
```

So now, my old workflow is back. When I merge a PR, I can run `git bdone` from the branch I merged to clean up the branches. All is right with the world again.
