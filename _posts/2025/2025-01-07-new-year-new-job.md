Last year I wrote a post, [career chutes and ladders](/archive/2024/12/10/chutes-and-ladder), where I proposed that a linear climb to the C-suite is not the only approach to a satisfying career. At the end of the post, I mentioned I was stepping off the ladder to take on an IC role.

After over a year of being on a personally funded sabbatical, I started a new job at [PostHog](https://posthog.com) as a Senior Product Engineer. This week is my orientation where I get to [drink from the firehose](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/10/26/drinking-from-the-firehose.aspx/) once again.

## What is PostHog?

Apart from being a company that seems to really love cute hedgehogs, PostHog is an open-source product analytics platform. They have a set of tools to help product engineers build better products. Each product can be used as a standalone tool, but they're designed to level-up when you put them together.

In particular, I've started on the [Feature Flags team](https://posthog.com/feature-flags). Yesterday was my first day of onboarding and so far I really like my team.

Today is day two and I've already submitted [a small fix for my first pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/27340)!

## Why PostHog?

When I was looking around at companies, an [old buddy from GitHub](https://github.com/phanatic) who worked at PostHog reached out to me and suggested I take a look at this company. He said it reminded him of the good parts of working at GitHub.

[Their company handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook) really impressed me. What it communicates to me is that this is a remote-friendly company that values transparency, autonomy, and trust. It's a company that treats its employees like adults and tries to minimize overhead.

Not only that, they've embraced a lot of employee-friendly practices. For example, a while back my friend Zach wrote about his [distaste for the 90 day exercise window](https://zachholman.com/posts/fuck-your-90-day-exercise-window/). PostHog [provides a 10-year window](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation). Not only that, they offer employes double trigger acceleration!

> [!NOTE]
> Double trigger acceleration means if you are let go or forced to leave due to the company being acquired, you receive all of your options at that time

This is a perk usually only offerered to executives.

*I should [mention we're hiring](https://posthog.com/careers)! Please mention me if you apply. If we've worked together, let me know so I can provide feedback internally.*

I'm excited to be part of a company that's small, but growing. The company is at a stage similar to the stage GitHub was at when I joined. This is a team with a strong product engineering culture and I'm excited to contribute what I can and learn from them.

## The Challenge

The other part that's exciting for me is that I'll be working in a stack that I don't have a huge amount of experience with. The front-end is React with TypeScript and the back-end is Django with Python. I've done a bit of work in all these technologies except Django. However, I believe my experience with ASP.NET MVC will help me pick up Django quickly.

Not to mention, I've always taken the stance that I'm a software engineer, not just a .NET developer. Don't get me wrong, I love working in .NET. But at the same time, I think it's healthy for me to get production experience in other stacks. It'll be an area of personal growth. Not to mention, they don't quite have a .NET Client SDK yet so once I get settled in, that's something I'm interested in getting started on.

## The Future

I'll share more about my experience here as I get settled in. In the meanwhile, wish me luck!
