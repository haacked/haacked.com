Anyone have recommendations for Content Management systems for ASP.NET
(ideally 2.0) that can handle a lot of traffic and allow for extremely
customized site design? I am curious about which products are out there
other than DotNetNuke and Microsoft Content Management Server.

Ideally this is something that you have implemented successfully on a
project.
