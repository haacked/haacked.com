Found this on [Wesner Moise's](http://wesnerm.blogs.com/) blog. He's
discussing the performance implications between managed and unmanaged
code.

> The working set for SharpReader is 30Mb, FeedDemon is 23 Mb, and RSS
> Bandit is 4 Mb in their initial configuration on my machine. (In
> comparison, the working set for MS Word and MS Excel are about 18
> Mbs.) So, actually in their bare configuration, RSS Bandit is the
> tightest of them all, even considering that RSS Bandit also uses the
> .NET runtime.
