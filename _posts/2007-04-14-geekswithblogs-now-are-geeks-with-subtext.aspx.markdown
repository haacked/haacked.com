The GeeksWithBlogs.net website just switched over its 1442 (and
counting) blogs, containing 25,921 blog posts and 39,140 comments over
to Subtext. As Jeff Julian reports, it only [took them six
hours](http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/archive/2007/04/13/111638.aspx "GWB is Subtext!").

Jeff posted a pic of the crew at work to make it happen (click for
larger).

[![GWB'ers burning the midnight
oil](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/GeeksWithBlogsNowAreGeeksWithSubtext_670/image%7B0%7D_thumb.png)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/GeeksWithBlogsNowAreGeeksWithSubtext_670/image%7B0%7D%5B2%5D.png "A late night at work")

Not depicted in the picture are members of the
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project") team who have
tried their best to be responsive and helpful to the GWB team during
their early planning phases for the move.

Subtext should handle the load just fine considering that they were
running on .TEXT prior, and though we’ve made a lot of changes, we
haven’t changed the data access code drastically.

Tip of the hat to [Scott
Watermasysk](http://scottwater.com/blog/ "Ancora Imparo - Scott’s Blog")
for building the original .TEXT code in a scalable manner, laying a good
foundation for this sort of installation.

Already, the large site may have sussed out
[a caching bug](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1700355&group_id=137896&atid=739981 "Multiblog Caching Bug")
we’ve been trying to track down for ages, but haven’t been able to
reproduce.

Anyways, congratulations to the GWB team for a successful migration.
