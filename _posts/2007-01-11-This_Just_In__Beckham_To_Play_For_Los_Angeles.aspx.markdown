[![David
Beckham](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/ThisJustInBeckhamToPlayForLosAngeles_8FE4/david-beckham-11_thumb.jpg)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/ThisJustInBeckhamToPlayForLosAngeles_8FE4/david-beckham-11%5B2%5D.jpg)Looks
like [Beckham is moving to La La
Land](http://www.mlive.com/sportsflash/topstories/index.ssf?/base/sports-2/1168529366198350.xml&storylist= "Beckham Signs With Galaxy").
Sure, he is no longer on the English national team, nor does he start
for Real Madrid, but I bet he’s still got some good playing days in
those legs, and will definitely be a huge lift for the level of play in
the MLS, or at least for the struggling Galaxy.

I'm just thinking I should’ve bought season tickets, because the price
probably just went way up.
