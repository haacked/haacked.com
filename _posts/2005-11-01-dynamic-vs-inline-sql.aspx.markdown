Perhaps there is a better term I could be using when I referred to
“dynamic SQL” [in my last
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/11/01/WhereTheProviderModelFallsShort.aspx).
To my defense, I did mention using [Prepared
Statements](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/adosql/adoprg02_97qr.asp).

The key point to keep in mind while reading the last post is that
*Dynamic SQL* does not necessarily imply *Inline SQL*. By inline SQL, I
mean concatenated sql statements flung all over the code like a first
year classic ASP developer.

Like any good security minded developer, I detest inline SQL (as I
define it here). A much better and safer approach is to use prepared
parameterized SQL as Jeff Atwood [outlines in this
post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000275.html).

So when I refer to *Dynamic SQL* I am referring to **dynamically
generated prepared parameterized SQL** (*that's a mouthful)*. These are
prepared parameterized SQL statements that are generated by machine and
not by hand.

As Jeff points out [in this
post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000117.html), “Stored
Procedures should be considered database assembly language: for use in
only the most performance critical situations.”

Taking that abstraction one step higher, you could also consider SQL
itself to be a form of database intermediate language. A dynamic SQL
engine generates SQL much like a compiler takes your C\# code and
generates IL? When that query is executed as a prepared parameterized
query, it is “jitted” by the database server into a high performance
database operation.

It seems to me a decent analogy for a Dynamic SQL engine such as those
built into LLBLGen Pro, NHibernate, etc...
