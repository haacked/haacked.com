I have a few great openings available that I have to share with you. 
These are really great positions working with really interesting and
smart people all over the world. 

**Some of the outstanding benefits include:**

-   Work from home.
-   Work for a great project lead (me!).
-   Work with an international team of really great developers.
-   Work on a product used by thousands of people and seen by many more.
-   Work tasks are pretty much self-directed.  Nobody is looking over
    your shoulder.
-   Set your own schedule and work at your own pace.
-   Interesting cutting-edge ASP.NET work. 
-   Gain great experience working on a product and increase your
    marketable skills.

**Some of the interesting projects include:**

-   Building a next-gen plugin architecture.
-   Localization and Internationalization.
-   Advanced Skinning architecture.
-   General application architecture and API improvement.
-   Streamlined UI design using AJAX.
-   Advanced Bayesian statistical analysis coding.
-   Windows CardSpaces and Infocard.

For such a great opportunity, I must warn you about a few of the
downsides.

-   No health care
-   No Pay

I have a gut feeling that second downside is going to be a bit of a deal
breaker for a lot of people.  But did I mention you can work as many or
as few hours as you wish?

As you probably figured out already, I am attempting to recruit people
to contribute to the [Subtext
Project](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project").  I have to cut
down the number of hours I put into the project for the rest of the year
and into the first couple months of the next year for a couple reasons I
will mention later.  I’ll still be heavily involved, but won’t be able
to contribute as much code as I have been.

### Why Accept No Pay For Work?

I’ve written on [this a bit
before](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/16/MisperceptionsofOpenSource.aspx "Misperceptions of Open Source").

However there is another angle I want to promote.  **It can help you get
a better job.**  On one hand, it helps you get experience in skillsets
you might not otherwise exercise at your current job.

[37signals](http://37signals.com "37 signals"), that über hot company
right now, see Open Source contributions as a [great way to
judge](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Actions_Not_Words.php "Actions, Not Words")
a potential candidate.

In fact, they only hire people they know through open source. Most
companies aren’t that extreme, but trust me, it’s a serious turn on to a
potential employer.

### Hmmm... I’m Intrigued. What Do You Need?

Great!  Glad you asked!

We have a great team as it stands, but we can always use more help in
any and every area.  Everyone is welcome to contribute to anything. Even
so, I would like to have a few people step up and become responsible for
a few areas.  That person doesn’t necessarily have to do the work in the
respective area, but just take ownership of getting people to contribute
and get it down.  Basically I want to decompose Subtext into multiple
smaller projects. Here are some of our needs: 

**Documentation Guru:**We need someone to be in charge of
documentation.  This would include making sure our [project
website](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") is up to
date.  It can also include generating NDoc documentation and posting it
on our site, etc...  In fact, it’d be nice to have our project website
redesigned to be a better resource for Subtext users.

**Build and Deployment Master:** Right now, this has been handled by a
combination of Me, [Steve
Harman](http://stevenharman.net/blog/ "Steve Harman"), and [Simone
(Simo) Chiaretta](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/piyo/ "Simone Chiaretta"). 
Unless Simo wants this title, I think it’d be nice to have one person be
responsible for maintaining our Continuous Integration and built scripts
as well as our final deployments.

**QA Manager and Testers:** We need more people to help out with QA
before we release builds, but one person to manage this process. I have
someone in mind for this, but I thought I’d put it out there since we
could use more help in this area.  This would include helping us
increase our unit test coverage and start getting WATIR tests going. 
After the last error plagued release (my fault), I want to get more
serious in this area.

**Developers, Developers, Developers:** And of course, we need more
developers!  We have several ongoing mini-projects we could use help
in.  Simo is chugging away on our new plugin framework, but I know he’d
appreciate some help as well as someone to start writing some initial
plugins to deploy with Subtext.

I have a new skinning architecture I want to get in place, but I won’t
have the time to implement it, though I can describe it to anyone who
will listen in great detail.

[Robb Allen](http://blog.robballen.com/ "Sharp as a Marble") is working
on our new membership provider.  I’m sure he’d love to have some help
finishing the integration with Subtext.

And there are many more minor tasks that we’d like to get done such as
general bug fixes, feature requests, code refactorings.  I’d like to
clean up some of our data access architecture to streamline it a bit.
Maybe even evaluate using Subsonic.

### Wrap Up

To be clear, any and all contributions are worthy and helpful.  I may be
ambitious asking for volunteers to take on these specific management
roles, but it’s worth a try.

However, if you have some time to contribute, but don’t want to take on
a management role, don’t let this dissuade you.  For example, if you
don’t have time to help manage the QA process, but can do testing for a
bit here and there when we are preparing a release, please jump on in! 

If you are interested in joining in the efforts, **start by subscribing
to the**[**subtext-devs mailing
list**](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/subtext-devs "Subtext-devs Mailing List") and
we’ll get you going.
