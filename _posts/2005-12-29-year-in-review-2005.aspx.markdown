In a blatant [ripoff of Scott
H](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott hanselman’s Blog"), I am going
to post the best of “You’ve Been Haacked” 2005 edition. This year, you
laughed, you cried and when you were done, you came over and briefly
glanced at my blog. But I took it in stride and continued to write, rant
and rave... and this was the best I could come up with in 2005^1^.
