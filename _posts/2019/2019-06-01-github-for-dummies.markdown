A while back, Zach Holman gave a great talk about [How GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub](https://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/). The talk focused a lot on GitHub's approach to coordinating work on [github.com](https://github.com/). But the way GitHub uses GitHub goes beyond code. It's not just github.com, but GitHub the company. For example, the employee handbook is in a GitHub repository. This makes it easy to suggest corrections and changes and see a history of its changes.

During my nearly seven year stint at GitHub, I was deeply emeshed in this way of working. It's especially powerful for coordinating the activities of distributed teams. So I think I can be forgiven for assuming everyone who uses GitHub works in this way.

It's not that I expected that everyone worked the same way. It's that I assumed everyone understood the set of features available to them. As I get involved with some distributed teams, I'm learning that people are not aware of features that would save them a lot of time and headache.

And it's understandable, GitHub picked up its pace with shipping features. But some of the features I'm thinking about have been around a long time. For example, the ability to [suggest a change to a pull request](https://github.blog/2018-11-01-suggested-changes-update/) without having to create a fork and submit another pull request is extremely useful.

If long-time GitHub users are not aware of these features, what about people new to GitHub? Using GitHub as a new developer, or as an experienced developer new to GitHub, can be daunting. If you're in this situation, or know someone who is, I have just the book for you.

My former colleague and friend, Sarah Guthals and I wrote a book about GitHub as part of the popular For Dummies series. The title, as you might guess, is GitHub for Dummies. It's [available on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Qr31t1).

[![GitHub For Dummies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/58595462-9400ec00-8225-11e9-8df5-b1c60312f9c6.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2Qr31t1)

The book covers a lot of interesting topics. Some of my favorites are the chapters that cover both sides of working on an open source repository. It contains great tips on how to be a good contributor (pro tip: put away that sense of entitlement) and how to be a good maintainer (pro tip: be kind and take care of your own health first). The book covers a lot of features you might not be aware of and shows them in the context of a typical developer workflow.

If you're an experienced user of GitHub, there might be some gems in the book for you. But the book is more geared towards developers and aspiring developers who are relatively new to GitHub. This would be a great book to purchase for career changers switching to software, students, etc. It's a great way to learn how to get the most out of GitHub.
