Surprisingly, most of my good friends who read this blog don't care much
about software development or .NET. They're not riveted by gripping
stories of flexible configuration section handlers, or the heart
palpitating episodes of my titanic battle with the StringDictionary's
handling of string casing. Nor do they spend their leisure moments
contemplating new and exciting IBlogExtension plugins.

What, pray tell, do these people do for fun, you ask? It's still a
mystery to me.

Last night my friend Walter told me that his interest wanes when I post
a long ode to code. He's one of those guys who like to read the "Human
Interest" stories in the paper (and my blog).

Many blogs (mine included) have post categories to group entries. I
could suggest that he subscribe to every category except for the
Software Dev & .NET, but as he uses Yahoo.com to subscribe, that would
really clutter his main page. It'd be great if Yahoo provided the
ability to subscribe to multiple categories of a single blog and present
that as one blog. At the very least they could display the category for
blog items.

However, if you don't mind the clutter, here are links to the RSS feeds
for each of my categories (thus far).

-   [Day To Day](http://haacked.com/category/1.aspx/rss): Basically a
    diary.
-   [Ha ha...ha...ha..that's so
    wrong!](http://haacked.com/category/4.aspx/rss): Funny stuff.
-   [In the News](http://haacked.com/category/10.aspx/rss): notable news
    items.
-   [Play That Funky Music](http://haacked.com/category/7.aspx/rss): the
    rare music review.
-   [Politics as Usual](http://haacked.com/category/9.aspx/rss): the
    occasional political rant.
-   [Geeked Out](http://haacked.com/category/3.aspx/rss): Gadjets,
    non-software tech.
-   [Software Dev and .NET](http://haacked.com/category/2.aspx/rss): the
    one Walt should skip.
