You ever work on a project trying to change out how something works and
uncover a beautiful elegant extensible design that just makes it a snap?
Me neither, but if I do run into such a phantasm, I’d probably get very
excited.

Well that’s how I feel about [A List
Apart's](http://www.alistapart.com/) new design. It just makes me go
“Unnnhhh!” (and that’s a good thing in case you didn’t know).

Taking a look at it, my first thought was “Steal Steal Steal!” And by
“Steal” I mean, “Be Insipired By”.

It’s such a cleanly laid out site that makes good use of screen
real-estate. I think current web-design is often stuck in late 90s
mentality that a page width has to fit within 800 pixels. Heck, my own
site is stuck in that mentality. But I noticed that A List Apart (ALA
for short) requires at least 952 pixels of width to fit it all in. By
not kowtowing to the remaining grandmas who still can’t crank the
resolution above 800x600, a lot of space is opened up to present more
information in a much cleaner fashion.

If I didn’t have so much work to do right now, I’d redesign [my
blog](http://haacked.com/) right now.
