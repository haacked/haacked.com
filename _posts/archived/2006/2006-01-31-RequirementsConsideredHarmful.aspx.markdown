[Micah delves into the dark
side](http://micahdylan.com/archive/2006/01/30/Requirementsmaybeharmful.aspx)
of requirement documents. I am glad he is taking on writing about some
of the challenges we’ve faced in starting a new company. I’ve been
planning to write about many of these challenges as well, but I wanted
to give myself more time. Perhaps I was a bit too shell-shocked by all
the difficulties to give it a proper treatment. Perhaps I was afraid I
would violate the one blogging rule we have, don’t be stupid.

Fortunately, Micah has the bravery to delve into the deep dark dirty
recesses of real world project management. Read it at your own risk and
hold tight to your sanity.
