When I was a bright eyed bushy tailed senior in
[college](http://www.oxy.edu/ "Go Tigers!"), I remember wading through
pages and pages of job ads in Jobtrak (which has since been absorbed
into [Monster.com](http://monster.com/ "Monster Jobs")).

Most of the ads held my attention in the same way reading a phone book
does. The bulk of them had something like the following format.

> **Responsibilites:**
>
> Design and develop data-driven internet based applications that meet
> functional and technical specifications. Use [technology X] and
> [technology Y] following the [methodology du jour] set of best
> practices. Create documentation, review code, and perform testing.
>
> **Required Skills and Experience:**
>
> Must have X years in language [now outdated language]. Must be
> proficient in BLAH, BLAH, and BLAH. Ability to work in a team
> environment. Able to work in a fast-paced [meaning we’ll work your ass
> off] environment.

I know what you’re thinking. *Where do I sign up!*

*Yaaaaawn*. Keep in mind, this was in 1997 just as the job market was
starting to reach the stratosphere. Competition was tight back then. Do
a search on [Dice.com](http://dice.com/ "Dice.com Job Board") right now
and you’ll still see a lot of the same.

I’m sorry, but your job posting is not the place to spew forth a list of
*Must have this* and *Must have that* and a list of responsibilities so
plain and vanilla that...that... I just don’t have a good analogy for
it. Sorry.

These type of ads are attempting to filter out candidates who do not
meet some laundry list of requirements. But this is not the goal of a
good job ad. A good job ad should not explain what hoops the candidate
must jump through to join your company, it should explain *why* the
candidate should even want to jump through those hoops in the first
place.

This of course assumes you are attempting to hire some star developers
away from their current jobs rather than resume padders who have spent
most of their careers in training classes so they can place your laundry
list of technology TLAs underneath their name on their resume.

Certainly, a job posting should explain briefly the type of work and
experience desired to fill the role. No point in having a person who
only has experience in sales and marketing applying for your senior DBA
position (true story). But first and foremost, you want to catch the
attention of a great candidate. Boring job ads that read like the one
above do not capture the imagination of good developers.

Back to my story. As I said, m*ost* of the ads fit this mold, but there
were a few here and there that popped off the screen. I wish I had saved
the one that really caught my attention. It was from a small company
named Sequoia Softworks (which is still around but now named
[Solien](http://www.solien.com/ "Solien")) My memory of it is vague, so
I’ll just make something up that resembles the spirit of the ad. All I
remember is that it started off by asking questions.

> Are you a fast learner and good problem solver? Are you interested in
> solving interesting business problems using the latest web
> technologies and building dynamic data driven web applications?
>
> We’re a small web development company in Seal Beach (right by the
> beach in fact!) looking for bright developers. We have a fun casual
> environment (we sometimes wear shorts to work) with some seriously
> interesting software projects.
>
> Experience in Perl, VBScript, and SQL is helpful, but being a quick
> learner is even more important. If you’ve got what it takes, give us a
> call.

I ended up working there for six years, moving up the ranks to end up as
the Manager of Software Development (never once writing a line of PERL).
They did several things right in their ad, as I recall.

#### Challenge the reader and demand an answer!

*Do you have two years experience in C#?* is not a challenge to the
reader. This is not a question that captures my attention nor draws me
in demanding an answer.

*Do you know C# like Paris Hilton knows manafacturing fame?*Now that is
a challenge to my intellect! *Hell yeah I know C# like nobody’s
business.* That kind of question demands an answer.  And a good
candidate is more likely to drive over to your headquarters and give it
to you.

#### Appeal to vanity

Not every appeal to vanity is a bad thing. It doesn’t always amount to
sucking up. This point is closely related to the last point in that an
appeal to vanity is also a challenge to a candidate to show just how
great they are. Asking someone if they are a good problem solver, for
example, conjures up a desire to prove it.

#### Show some personality

Sure, many corporations seem like soulless cubicle farms in which
workers are seen as mindless drones. But surely not *your* company,
right? So why does your job posting have a tombstone all over it?

Who wants to be another cog in a machine performing mundane tasks for
god knows what reason? Your ad should express a bit of your company’s
personality and culture.  It should also indicate to the reader that
people who come to work for you are going to work with people.
**Interesting people**. And they are going to work on **interesting
projects**.

I write all this because of an article I read about business schools. It
was a throw-away quote in which some employer mentioned how his new
employee fresh out of business school helped rewrite some job postings
and they were able to quickly fill some positions with high quality
candidates they had been struggling to fill.

A well written job posting makes a difference.

I [mentioned
before](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/04/Better_Recruiting_Through_Blogistry.aspx "Better Recruiting through Blogistry")
that I am participating in the
[HiddenNetwork](http://hiddennetwork.com/ "Hidden Network Job Boards")
job board network because I really believe in the power of blogs to
connect good people with good jobs. It’s in its nascent stages so I
really don’t know how well it is fulfilling that mission yet, but I
believe that it will do well.

If you do [post a
job](http://adserver.hiddennetwork.com/1002/post.aspx "Post a Job") via
my blog (yes, I get a little something something if you do), be sure to
make it a good posting that really captures the imagination of good
developers (*as all my readers are!  See. Appeal to vanity.*). It’s even
more of a challenge given how few words you have at your disposal for
these ads.
