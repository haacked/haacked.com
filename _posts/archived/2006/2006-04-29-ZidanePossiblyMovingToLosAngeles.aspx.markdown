![Zinedine Zidane](https://haacked.com/assets/images/ZinedineZidane.jpg) I hear
from a fairly reliable source that after the World Cup, Zinedine Zidane
plans to move to Los Angeles to get into some kind of entertainment.
That in and of itself is not exceedingly interesting. However, this
source also tells me that Zidane has been offered a spot on the
Hollywood United roster thanks to the other ex-French [national team
player, Frank
LeBeouf](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/03/24/PlayingAgainstAWorldCupWinner.aspx "Playing Against A World Cup Winner").

That means that sometime in the near future, there is a small chance
(you know how plans can change) that I may play in a soccer game against
Zinedine Zidane, one of the world’s best players! Even though on the
field, he will be just another opponent, I will probably bring my camera
and try and get a pic with him before the game.

Although we would be in the same league, we are definitely not in the
same *league*. Honestly, this all sounds a bit outlandish. I mean, he
currently plays on *Real Madrid* for Pete’s sake! He is by no means over
the hill yet. He could, if he wanted, join the MLS and completely
dominate. Going from Real Madrid to our league would be a major drop in
action.

On the other hand, if he really is retiring, a low key game once a week
might be just the thing to keep in shape and not place such demands on
his time.

In any case, does anybody out there know of any ex-professionals who are
looking for a league in Los Angeles? Brazillian national team players
are especially welcome. Whatever happened to Bebeto and Romario?
