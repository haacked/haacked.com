![Power mast](https://haacked.com/assets/images/PowerMast.jpg) Just had a short
power outtage at home, which sucks because I work here. I was taking a
short break downstairs reading when the lights suddenly turned off. I
had that feeling that must go through the head of the lone security guy
just before Sidney Bristow busts his head with her fist.

Fortunately no commandos busted down the door to my place. The
unfortunate part is that my computer was upstairs doing its computing
thing.   *Poof!  * Data lost. It seems like we have these outtages every
other month or so, which is too much for my liking.

Anyways, on to my point. Does anyone have any good recommendations for
UPS systems for personal use? I would like to stay around the   $50
range, but if you know of one that can signal the computer to go into
hibernation, I might be open to spending more.
