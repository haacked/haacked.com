![Subtext Logo](/assets/images/SubtextLogo.png) Well it took a bit longer than
I thought it would, but we’ve finally put the final touches to [Subtext
1.0](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Site"), code named
“Nautilus”! One of the primary goals of this release was to make it much
easier to setup and use than .TEXT, and I think we’ve accomplished that.

Acknowledgements
----------------

It is a LOT of work delivering an open source product, especially given
that all this work is done in our spare time. A big thanks goes out to
all the contributors: those who submitted code as well as those who
contributed ideas and encouragement (especially my wife who has been
very understanding of my code obsession and made me a fantastic cup of
tea last night as I tried to finalize the release). All of it is helpful
and appreciated.

In particular I want to [give much credit to the
team](http://subtextproject.com/About/TheTeam/ "The Subtext Development Team")
who have put in a lot of effort lately to get this ready. Robb, I am
ready for that homebrewed beer!

I also want to highlight [TurboMilk](http://turbomilk.com/ "TurboMilk"),
the creative folks who designed our logo.

Installation
------------

Check out the [installation
guide](http://subtextproject.com/Docs/Installation/ "Installation Guide")
on our [project
site](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") for a
walkthrough of the installation. There are also a couple screen casts if
you are the more visual type.

New Features
------------

There are many small improvements both under the hood and in the UI.
Here are some of the highlights...

-   **Web Based Installer** - Installs the database schema and stored
    procedures.
-   **BlogML Support** - Import and export your blog data to and from
    other blogs that support this new standard.
-   **.TEXT 0.95 Import Wizard** - This is a direct database to database
    import.
-   **Host Admin Tool** - Use this to manage multiple blogs
-   **Improved multi-blog support**. Read the [configuration
    docs](http://subtextproject.com/Docs/Configuration/ "Subtext Configuration Docs")
    for more details.
-   **Improved Documentation** - We’ve gone out of our way to improve
    documentation as much as possible.
-   **Logging Console** - The first iteration of this console displays
    error messages in the admin section. You can update the
    Log4Net.config file to change logging levels.

Interface Improvements
----------------------

These were designed to spiff up the look of Subtext and remove some of
the headaches in .TEXT

-   **New Skins** - We added some spiffy new skins for your blog
    delight.
-   **Recent Comments Skin Control** - Display recent comments on your
    blog (requires editing a skin if it doesn’t have the control
    already).
-   **Multiple Comment Deletion** - Rather than deleting comments one at
    a time, check them off and delete them in bulk.
-   **Single Web.config file** - There’s only one web.config file to
    worry about.
-   **Comments disabled after N days** - Where N is an integer of your
    chosing zero or larger.
-   **Comments throttling** - Specify a delay between comments as well
    as filter out exact duplicates. This is good for those repetitive
    spam bot attacks.
-   **Edit Link Control** - when logged in as an admin, an edit link
    appears next to post titles (requires editing a skin if it doesn’t
    have the control already).

Under the hood
--------------

This is for you developers out there. Holla!

-   **Unit Tests** - We added a bunch of unit tests (using MbUnit) to
    the codebase. We are by no means where we want to be regarding code
    coverage, but it is a step in the right direction.
-   **NDoc** - We included an NDoc file and compiled help file of the
    code base.
-   **FxCop** - We have way too many FxCop violations, but at least we
    know we do via our FxCop project file.
-   **NAnt Build File** - Build the entire solution from the command
    line. Choosing the “doc” target builds a compiled help file.
-   **RFC3229 Delta Encoding** - Potentially saves on bandwidth once
    clients start implementing their side of the protocol.
-   **RSS GZIP Compression** - Compress that baby.
-   **Fixed MetaBlogAPI** - Fixed a few bugs with the MetaBlogAPI
    implementation. You can now edit blog posts via w.Bloggar.

What’s Next?
------------

The next version of Subtext code-named “Daedelus” will focus on
delivering a Plugin framework along with a few plugins. That will be the
key deliverable. You can view the
[Roadmap](http://subtextproject.com/Roadmap/ "Subtext Roadmap") to see
other planned features, but be aware that we may revise this list soon
in order to keep the next release tightly focused. Deliver early and
often I always say.
