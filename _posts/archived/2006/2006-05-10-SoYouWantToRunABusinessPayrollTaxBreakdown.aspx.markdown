I recently set up Payroll via Paychex for my company. It is an eye
opener to see exactly what taxes an employer pays **on top of** the
taxes already deducted from each employee’s paycheck. I mean, I always
heard that my employers were paying taxes for me when I was an employee,
but I never knew how much. Till now.

This is helpful when figuring out your total compensation as it is part
of the hidden cost of going into business for yourself. Of course, we
are a C-Corp so these figure may be different for other types of
businesses. I wouldn’t know and this does not qualify as tax advice.

### Tax Breakdown

Tax                    | Rate
-----------------------|------
_Social Security_      | 6.2%
_Medicare_             | 1.45%
_Federal Unemployment_ | 0.8%
_State Unemployment_   | 0.8%

State of CA. This changes.

#### Some Notes:

Social Security has a wage base limit of \$94,200. So if an employee
makes more than that (including bonuses etc...), the employer will only
be taxed 6.2% of \$94,200.

Medicare has no wage based limit.

The last two taxes are only taxed on the first \$7000 of wages per
employee per year. So the employer pays 3.4% of \$7000 for each employee
assuming each makes \$7000 or more a year.

So make sure these figure into your cash-flow estimates. Also, don’t
forget that by law, most companies are required to carry Workman’s
compensation insurance. That will cost you a small chunk of change per
year as well.
