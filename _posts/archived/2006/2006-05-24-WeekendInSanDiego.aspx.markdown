I don’t write much about my personal life here because most days are
pretty mundane and not unlike other days I’ve had. If I were to write
about my day, most entries would look like the following...

> Today I woke up, had some breakfast, said goodbye to the wife, read my
> blogs, wrote some code, walked the dog, said hello to the wife, ate
> dinner, spent time with the wife, worked some more, snuck in a bit of
> Oblivion, went to sleep.

What a travesty of a run-on sentence!

So, my dear readers, I have done you a service of sparing you the
banality of my life.

However this weekend is a bit special as my wife’s family (mom, brother,
and brother’s wife) are in town from Japan to observer the one year
anniversary of her [otosan (dad) passing
away](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/22/ALossInTheFamily.aspx "A Loss In The Family").

While last year was an understandably somber affair, this year has been
very light and fun. We drove down to Chula Vista to visit the location
in which he was found. Afterwards, we drove up to San Diego and had the
best sushi around at Sushi Ota. Mr. Ota (or Ota-san as we call him) is a
family friend and took very good care of us, making all sorts of
creative interstitial treats between our orders.

[Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway "Jon Galloway") also
stopped by the Residence Inn where we were staying so I could trash him
in table tennis. I had to lighten up on my vicious serve a bit otherwise
it just would’ve been ugly.

We also took a boat ride in Oceanside to the point at which we spread
Otosan’s ashes. My brother-in-law took some great photos, such as the
sea lions basking on a buoy.

Everytime I ride the boat I start to wonder what it would be like to
sell our place and live on a boat. But I realize they have the same
parking congestion that we have.

Today I am back in Los Angeles and back to work while they are out
shopping. It is interesting to see their shopping choices. They were so
excited to purchase some sets of tupperware at Ikea because it was the
fraction of the cost of similar containers in Tokyo.
