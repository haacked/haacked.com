Today my team had a friendly preseason game against Hollywood United.
They fielded a mixture of a few players from their 40 and over team, but
most of the players were from their main team.

While [Alexi and Frank were not
there](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/23/Soccer_Beat_Down.aspx "Soccer Beat Down") today, Hollywood
did field the *Mean Machine*, [Vinnie
Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinnie_Jones "Vinnie Jones on Wikipedia").
He is a former professional player from England who was part of the
*Crazy Gang* team that won the FA cup in 1988. He’s notorious for dirty
play, but now more well known for his acting, such as the role of the
Juggernaut in X-Men 3.

Despite being known for his rough tactics, it still takes talent to play
at the level he played at, and it showed today. He put in a sweet
freekick to the upper corner. And yes, he looks even meaner in person
than he does on film. He’s a tough looking Mofo.

Another well-known player was Steve Jones, former guitarist for the punk
band the Sex Pistols, who also hosts Jonesy’s Jukebox. [Jimmy
Jean-Louis](http://imdb.com/name/nm1097515/ "Jimmy Jean-Louis") is also
on the team. He plays the guy who can erase memories on the new NBC
show, Heroes. They’re not kidding when they call themselves *Hollywood*
United.

At the end of regulation, we were tied 4 to 4. Since it was a friendly
and we had paid for the field for 10 more minutes, we played a
short overtime period in which they scored two more goals, the final
being 6 to 4. We should’ve faked injuries and left while we were tied.
