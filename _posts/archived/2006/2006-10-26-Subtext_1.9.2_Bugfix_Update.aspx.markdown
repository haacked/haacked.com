As I mentioned in [my last
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/26/PATCH_Cannot_Delete_Posts_In_Subtext_1.9.2.aspx "Cannot Delete Posts"),
someone reported a bug with deleting posts in the admin tool.  That
posts also describes a quick and dirty workaround.

However, I fixed the bug and updated our current 1.9.2 release at
SourceForge.  The [existing URL to download the
release](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137896&package_id=181920&release_id=458502 "Download Subtext 1.9.2")
is still valid.  The full version number for this release is
**1.9.2.23**.

To find out which version of Subtext you are running, just log into your
admin and look in the bottom left corner.  You should see the version
there.

If you downloaded Subtext 1.9.2 before I applied the update, then you
will probably see version 1.9.2.19 in there.  If so, you have two
options.  You can either apply the [quick and dirty patch mentioned in
my last
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/26/PATCH_Cannot_Delete_Posts_In_Subtext_1.9.2.aspx "Quick and dirty patch"),
or you can download the latest build and update the
`Subtext.Framework.dll` file in the `bin` directory.

However, this latest update also includes some CSS fixes for the KeyWest
skin in IE 7 designed (and fixed) by [Robb
Allen](http://blog.robballen.com/ "Robb Allen").  So if you are using
that skin, you should download and apply this update.
