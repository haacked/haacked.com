[Conceptus,](http://conceptus.com/) a client of [my
company](http://veloc-it.com/), recently launched not one, but **two**
blogs using [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/).

I emphasize two because I only really knew that their CEO wanted to
[start a blog](http://blog.conceptus.com/subtext/).  Of course, once you
have Subtext set up, it's quite easy to [start another
blog](http://blog.essure.com/subtext/).

This is our first (of hopefully many) commercial implementations of
Subtext.  The best thing about this particular project was that our
client was very kind in contributing some of the customization work we
did back to the Subtext project.

For me, I loved that this projected combined my passion for Subtext with
my passion for feeding my family.

**DISCLAIMER:** I am not a medical professional so my brief description
of the product is not medical advice. This is merely information I
gleaned off their [product website](http://essure.com/).  For medical
advice, consult your doctor.

To give you more background, the client is named
[Conceptus](http://conceptus.com/) and they’ve developed a
**non-surgical** permanent birth control device and procedure that takes
around 35 minutes (not including doctor waiting room time and a typical
post procedure wait of 45 minutes).  Their procedure beats the pants off
the typical alternative, tubal ligation (getting the tubes tied).

We worked with this client before under the direction of [Shepard
Associates](http://www.shepardassociates.com/) to
develop Conceptus's [consumer focused site](http://essure.com/) and
their [doctor focused site](http://essuremd.com/), both built on top of
[DotNetNuke](http://dotnetnuke.com/).
