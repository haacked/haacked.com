Well my friends, it took a bit longer than expected to get Subtext 1.9
out the door, but we did it.  When we [released Subtext
1.5](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/06/07/Subtext1.5NautilusRAndREditionReleased.aspx "Subtext 1.5 announcement") back
in June I said,

> The next version of Subtext is code named **Daedelus**. It will simply

Well that was then and this is now and I was wrong about the *quick
turnaround*.

We realized that a straight port to ASP.NET 2.0 wasn’t much fun if we
couldn’t take advantage of some of the new goodies that ASP.NET 2.0
has.  So we spent a significant amount of time cleaning up code and
refactoring some functionality to take advantage of what ASP.NET 2.0
offers.  A lot of the changes are under the hood, but there are still a
few surface level treats for everybody.

Before you upgrade to 1.9, please check out my [notes on
upgrading](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/31/Important_Note_On_Upgrading_to_Subtext_1.9.aspx "important note on upgrading Subtext").

So what is new in Subtext 1.9 besides that it is now an ASP.NET 2.0
application?

Under The Hood
--------------

Let’s not kid ourselves. 99.999% (Five nines baby!) of my readers are
geeks and we want to pop open the hood and take a look around.

1.  Subtext Providers have been refactored to use the Microsoft base
    Provider class, `System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase`.
2.  Used Generics where appropriate.  As you know, there is a lot of
    temptation when given a new hammer to start looking at everything as
    a nail.  We tried to avoid that temptation and make judicious use of
    Generics.  I think we did a bang up job.  Most of our collection
    classes are now generic collections and there’s
    that [`CollectionBook`](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/14/FunIteratingPagedCollectionsWithGenericsAndIterators.aspx "Fun iterating PagedCollections")
    class I wrote about recently.
3.  Improved our Continuous Integration and build process using
    CruiseControl.NET.  We now have a [nice
    dashboard](http://haacked.dyndns.org/ccnet/ "CCNET Dashboard") that
    provides a lot of visibility into our development progress.
4.  Improved our unit test [code
    coverage](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/11/03/CodeCoverageIsNotEnough.aspx "Code Coverage is not enough")
    to 36.4% and counting. (When I started it was pretty much 0)
5.  Subtext now runs under Medium Trust without problems except for the
    [Trackback/Pingback
    issue](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/07/10/MoreOnMediumTrustAndTrackbacks.aspx "Trackbacks in Medium Trust").
6.  Converted the Subtext.Web project into a [Web Application
    Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/reference/infrastructure/wap/default.aspx "Web Application Project").
7.  Added a *\_System* folder to the Skins directory. This contains some
    CSS files that any skin may reference which provide some common CSS
    layout and styles.  For example, by referencing commonstyle.css, you
    can use the *pullout* css class to pullout some text.  Custom skins
    can reference these files and override specific settings, putting
    the *Cascading* back in CSS.

Try out the new “pullout” or “pullout.alt” CSS classes.

New Features
------------

Some new features we added.

1.  Sometimes removing code is as much a feature as adding code.  As I
    [announced
    earlier](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/26/Developing_Custom_Skins.aspx "Developing Custom Skins"),
    we removed some old skins and added some snazzy new ones.  We also
    implemented a way for custom skin definitions to not get overwritten
    when upgrading code.
2.  Improvements to the packaged skins.  We added the Previous/Next
    control to nearly every skin as well as [Gravatar
    support](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Docs/Configuration/ConfiguringGravatars/tabid/149/Default.aspx "Configuring Gravatars") among
    other minor improvements.
3.  **Comment Moderation!**  This high demand feature was fast-tracked
    when [my company](http://veloc-it.com/ "My Day Job") was hired to
    implement it for a client who wished to start a blog. The client
    agreed to contribute the source back to the project!
4.  Not exactly a new feature, but we changed the default Html Editor to
    use the [FCKEditor](http://www.fckeditor.net/ "Html Editor").
5.  Implemented
    [RSD](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/tech/rsd.html "Really Simple Discovery")
    (Really Simple Discovery) and the [MetaWeblog
    API’s](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi "RFC") `newMediaObject`
    method so that Subtext works quite well with [Windows Live
    Writer](http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1 "WLW Beta Announcement").

Bug Fixes
---------

There are probably too many to list, but I'll point out a few that
people may have noticed.

1.  [[1524172](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1524172&group_id=137896&atid=739979 "SourceForge")]

2.  [[1524371](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1524371&group_id=137896&atid=739979 "SourceForge")]

3.  [[1521317](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1521317&group_id=137896&atid=739979 "SourceForge")]

Important Note
--------------

Subtext ships with
[ReverseDOS](http://www.angrypets.com/tools/rdos/ "Angry Pets ReverseDOS")
spam blocker enabled out of the box. Please check the ReverseDOS.config
file to make sure that it is not filtering any terms that would be
relevant to comments in your blog. You can also disable ReverseDOS by
removing any reference to it from Web.config should you so desire.

Plans For The Future
--------------------

We are now gearing up for Subtext 2.0 “Poseidon”, our next major
release, which will feature a plugin framework.  Our hope is to foster a
community of plugin contributions.  Other features in the works include
a Membership provider which will allow multiple authors for a single
blog and a new skinning framework. I will update the
[Roadmap](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Roadmap/tabid/55/Default.aspx "Subtext Roadmap")
soon to reflect our current plans for 2.0.

Also, with the [recent
deluge](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/29/Comment_Spam_Heuristics.aspx "Comment Spam Heuristics")
in comment spam, I am considering having an interim release (1.9.1) that
would include [Akismet](http://akismet.com/ "Akismet") as well as
semi-moderation (1.9 does include full moderation now). Ideally we would
save these features until we have a plugin framework, as they seem like
great candidates for plugins. However the communal benefit of blocking
spam may be too great to wait.

Many thanks to the growing numbers of Subtext contributors who helped
shape and test this release.  All your efforts, whether it is coding,
submitting patches, testing, reporting bugs, requesting features, or
just giving us a piece of your mind are appreciated!
