It is a common notion that there is a lot of ambiguity and disagreement
around the term *Open Source*. While that has been true in the past, I
believe that there is much more consensus now because the term has been
refined and the taxonomy of software has been improved. Certainly there
are still arguments, but I believe for the most part, there is a
detente.

Much of the past ambiguity surrounded the philosophical disagreements
between those who felt software should be free as in liberty, not only
free as in beer. This view essentially holds that derivative works of
*Free Software* must themselves be open and *Free*. [Richard
Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman "Richard Stallman on Wikipedia")
(who does not want to be associated with the term *Open Source*)
embodies this philosophy, as does the [GPL
license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt "GPL License in Plain Text").

The opposition felt that we should not place such restrictions on
software to consider it *Open Source*.

While this disagreement may have been heated at times, in many ways the
core argument around the term *Open Source* has been resolved by
differentiating between *Free Software* and Open Source. There are now
sites dedicated to the [Free Software
Definition](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html "Free Software Definition")
and the [Open Source
Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php "Open Source Definition")
to promote these terms.

While there are certainly disagreements between the two camps on how
software should be licensed, in many ways the camps are compatible. When
looking specifically at the licenses, it is helpful to think of *Open
Source* as a superset of *Free Software*. *Free Software* is necessarily
*Open Source*, but an *Open Source* is not necessarily *Free Software*
because a *Free Software* license is in general as restrictive or more
restrictive than an *Open Source* license.

Likewise a *Source Available* is not necessarily *Open Source*, but
*Open Source* is necessarily *Source Available*.

In my hope to be a
[neologist](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/neologist "Person who coins new words"),
I will push the term *Source Available* (I like it better than my
earlier term *Code Available*) and hope it catches on. If someone coined
it before me, at least I hope the claim to fame of making it popular. ;)

I have written on the topic of Open Source software before if you are
interested.
