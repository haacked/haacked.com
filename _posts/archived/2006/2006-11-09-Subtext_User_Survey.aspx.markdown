![Subtext Logo](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SubtextLogo.png) I put up a
[short three question
survey](http://subtextproject.com/Home/About/UserSurvey/tabid/159/Default.aspx "Survey")
on the Subtext
website.  If you are a subtext user or thinking about using Subtext,
please take a moment and fill it out. It’ll only take a second.

**For the first question, if you choose *Other*, please be kind and
comment on this post what that other hosting provider is. Thanks!**

The third question bears a bit of explanation.  If you use the web admin
to enter a blog post, the *Advanced Options* allow you to enter a short
excerpt for the blog post.  My hunch is that nobody uses it.

This excerpt is displayed when listing posts within a category.  I think
we might be better served by having some means to automatically generate
an excerpt OR to allow users to mark up their blog posts when using a
3rd party tool so that we can extract an excerpt.

After I get in some results to this survey, I’ll talk about that some
more.  Over time I may add some more questions.  So please, if you have
a moment, [take the
survey](http://subtextproject.com/Home/About/UserSurvey/tabid/159/Default.aspx "The Subtext User Survey").
