Ok, so I accidentally ran into that [pregnant woman
photo](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/03/06/BeyondChannel9.aspx "Beyond Channel 9")
that the on10 team used to hint at what was coming next. It is in the
third row of [search
results](http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=search&w=1&txt=rest&p=2 "Stock Exchange")
for the same free stock photo site I use. Thought it was kind of funny
as I was searching for the term “rest”
