So in the hustle and bustle of trying to get my Yahoo account back (it
has been returned), I forgot to show some love for JackAce of the [Code
Turkey](http://codeturkey.blogspot.com/ "Code Turkey") blog. He and I
used to work at SkillJam and he was the one who alerted me via email
that my account had been jacked.

In [this
post](http://codeturkey.blogspot.com/2006/04/searching-for-im-phisher.html "Anatomy of a phishing attack"),
he describes the general tactic that an Instant Messaging based attack
takes to spread itself.

He also provides some tips to avoid phishing and talks about what to do
if you are phised. Be careful out there.
