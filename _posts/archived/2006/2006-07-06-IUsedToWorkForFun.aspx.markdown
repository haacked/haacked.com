Jeff asks the question, “Isn’t programming supposed to be fun?”? Ha ha
ha, naive little bunny. As if the person who invented programming had
*fun* in mind. Silly rabbit.

You’ve heard the cliche. The reason it is called *work* is because it is
*work*. Programming is fun when it is just for fun.

Cynical jokes aside, I actually did work for fun at my last job. Well
technically, I worked for FUN. My [former
employer](http://www.skilljamcorp.com/ "SkillJam Corporation Site") was
bought by a
[company](http://www.funtechnologies.com/ "Fun Technologies") that then
changed its name to Fun Technologies. It is listed under the symbol FUN
on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Alternative Invesment Market of
the London Stock Exchange.

When I visited headquarters in Toronto the CEO gave me a hat with the
ticker symbol emlazoned on the front. I think I still have it somewhere.
I would wear it and go around telling people that I work for FUN. It was
mildly funny for about two minutes. But as is my style, I dragged it out
for thirty.
