After completing [two of the three
books](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/12/26/11370.aspx "2006 Reading List")
I said I would be reading in 2006, I decided to apply some of the
lessons from the book [Bulletproof Web
Design](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0321346939&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&camp=1789&creative=9325)
by [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/ "Dan Cederholm's Website") by
slightly redesigning my site.

The change isn’t drastic on the surface, though I like to think it looks
nicer and cleaner. Most of the changes are under the hood in the HTML
and CSS. Most of you won’t notice since you read this via an RSS
aggregator, but if you have a moment, [take a
look](https://haacked.com/ "My Blog") and let me know what you think.

A short book review is forthcoming.
