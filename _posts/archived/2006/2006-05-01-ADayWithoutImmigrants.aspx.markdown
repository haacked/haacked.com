Downtown Los Angeles experienced a huge march today to protest bill [HR
4437](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR_4437 "Bill HR 4437") and support
immigrant rights and immigration reforms. I had been waffling about
attending since I really hate driving to downtown (bad traffic and
parking), but realized that since both my mother and my wife are
immigrants, I ought to come out and show some support. An IM from my
friend Kyle telling me I won’t regret it also served to jolt me out of
my complacency.

Besides, my wife works on the corner where the march starts so I could
just park nearby, have lunch with her, and join in the march. So I
hopped in my car, grabbed a white shirt for my wife (everyone was
encouraged to wear white), and headed off to downtown. Traffic was
actually better than I have ever seen it on the 10 East.

When I arrived, I was greeted with the sounds of helicopters hovering
overhead and people cheering. I was then assaulted by the smell of
street vendor cooking in the air which instantly made me hungry and
ready to part with some money despite the boycott. I proceeded to walk
right through the parade in order to get to Akumi’s office.

Once there, I ran up to the roof to take some photos.

The photos from the roof do not even begin to give you a sense of how
many people were there. Multiple city blocks were chock full of people
chanting, singing, and dancing. The air was electric.

Even the little ones were into it.

Though this one was tuckered out.

The crowd was primarily latino. I had hoped to see a more diverse crowd
show up in support, but I did manage to find the one other white guy.

We took a shortcut to the end point of the march where everyone was
gathering, but didn’t feel like braving the crowds much longer.

I stepped aside for a moment to get a better view for a picture and when
I looked back, I could not see my wife. Since everyone was wearing
white, it was easy for me to lose track of her. What was I going to do?
Ask everyone if they’ve seen a woman wearing a white shirt, blue jeans,
with black hair? That described half the entire crowd. It was a
beautiful day out there.
