[Alex
Papadimoulis](http://weblogs.asp.net/Alex%5FPapadimoulis/ "Alex Papadimoulis' Blog"),
the man behind the ever entertaining (and depressing)
[TheDailyWTF](http://thedailywtf.com/ "The Daily WTF") announces a [new
business
venture](http://thedailywtf.com/forums/thread/94341.aspx "Introducing the Hidden Network")
to help connect employers fielding good jobs with good developers
interested in a career change.  At least that’s the hope.

[The Hidden Network](https://hiddennetwork.com/ "HiddenNetwork") is the
name of the venture and the plan is to pay bloggers \$5.00 per
thousand ad views (cha-ching!) for hosting pre-screened job postings in
small ad blocks that look very similar to the standard Google AdSense
ad.  In the interest of full disclosure, I will be taking part as a
blogger hosting these job postings.

I’ve written before about how [hiring is
challenging](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/12/16/Hiring_Is_Challenging.aspx "Hiring is Challenging") and
that blogs are a great means to connecting with and hiring good
developers.  In fact, that’s how I recruited [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway") to join my
company, brought in [Steve
Harman](http://stevenharman.net/blog/ "Steve Harman’s Blog") (a
Subtext
Developer) as a contractor, and almost landed another well known
blogger, until his own company grabbed his leg and dragged him kicking
and screaming back into the fold giving him anything he wanted (I kid).

My hope is that somehow, my blog helps connect a good employer with a
good developer. It’s worked for my company, it may work for yours. 
Connecting good developers with good jobs is a win win experience for
all.  My fear is that the ads will turn into a bunch of phising
expeditions by headhunders looking to collect resumes.  It will be
imperative that Hidden Network work hard at trying to filter out all but
the high quality job postings.

As Alex states in the [comments of that
post](http://thedailywtf.com/forums/permalink/94341/94353/ShowThread.aspx#94353 "Comment on DailyWTF"),
blogs are the new Trade Publications, so paying \$5.00 per CPM is quite
sustainable and viable.  It will be interesting to see if his grand
experiment works out.
