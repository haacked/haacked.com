I recently learned about
[DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/ "DotNetKicks") due to a
referral in my referrer logs. It is essentially a
[Digg](http://digg.com/ "Digg") knockoff, but tightly focused on the
.NET community, which makes it a nice complement to Digg.

Recently, security expert [Bruce
Shneier](http://www.schneier.com/blog/ "Bruce Shneier's Blog") wrote a
piece on how security can be improved by [aligning interest with
capability](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/06/aligning_intere.html "Aligning interests").
One example he gives is how some retail stores promise refunds if you
don’t get a receipt. This keeps the employee working the register honest
by aligning the store owner’s security interest with the interests of
the customers. The owner is effectively hiring the customers to keep
employees honest.

In a similar manner, DotNetKicks has done the same thing to promote its
own growth. If you have an AdSense account, you can submit your AdSense
ID and earn 50% of the advertisement revenue on the site for all stories
that you submit. This aligns story submitters' interests with
DotNetKicks’ interest and should go along way to ensure that more
stories are submitted.

Of course, the signal to noise ratio of submitted stories may go down as
a result, but that is hardly a concern because only the stories that the
community deem interesting, via the voting system, percolate to the
front page and have any chance of really generating advertising revenue.
The question I have is what is the incentive to users to kick stories
apart from the community benefits?
