I noticed this [odd
post](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2006/05/26/qwert.html "Dan Cederholm")
on SimpleBits, Dan Cederholm’s website. It is a list of words that he
can easily type with his left hand. One has to ask for what reason he is
keeping his right hand free? But I, being a man of good taste, won’t go
there.

For me, this list is quite different. Several years ago I was suffering
from a lot of wrist pain due to typing. I started looking into all sorts
of remedies. One remedy I tried was taking some time to learn the
[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard
layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard "Dvorak Simplified Keyboard").
My coworker at the time (and now business partner)
[Micah](http://micahdylan.com/ "Micah Dylan") also did the same.

We simply full on took the plunge at work. It was a slow period so we
downloaded a little practice app, switched our regional settings to
Dvorak, and started practicing. When I had to respond to emails or write
code, it was quite laughable how slow and clumsy I was...at first.

Soon enough I picked up speed and probably type faster in Dvorak than I
ever did in QWERTY. Since I never got around to buying a Dvorak
keyboard, I was forced to really learn touch typing. If you watch me
type slowly on a keyboard, it would confuse the heck out of you as I am
hitting all the wrong keys to produce the right letters.

In any case, here are a few words that I can type with my left hand
using the Dvorak layout.

-   puke
-   pee
-   keep
-   peak
-   quake
-   pique
-   oak
-   quux (metasyntactic variable such as foo, bar, baz)

That is quite a limited vocabulary.
