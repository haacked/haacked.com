A while ago I told you that I was starting [a
company](http://micahdylan.com/archive/2006/01/27/TheThreeAmigos.aspx)
with my business partner, [Micah](http://micahdylan.com/). Well the good
news is that we’ve officially added [another
partner/employee](http://micahdylan.com/archive/2006/01/27/TheThreeAmigos.aspx),
the indefatigable [Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/).

In the link to Micah breaking the news, he says he is really glad our
clients don’t pay us to look pretty or we’d be broke. He can speak for
himself, because if he read the fine print on the contract I’m working
on, being pretty is indeed one of the requirements.
