Way back when I announced the [first Roadmap for
Subtext](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/05/2983.aspx), I stated that
Subtext would remove the multiple blogs feature and only support a
single blog.  Fortunately I was persuaded by many commenters to abandon
that change and continue to support multiple blogs.  Instead, I set out
to simplify the process of configuring multiple blogs.

Now I am really glad that I did so.  I currently have three blogs
running off of a single installation of Subtext.

1.  This one [https://haacked.com/](https://haacked.com/)
2.  My non-techie blog
    [http://phil.haacked.com/](http://phil.haacked.com/)
3.  My soccer team
    [http://westsiderovers.com/](http://westsiderovers.com/)

The benefit of this approach is that setting up a new blog is very easy.
Rather than dealing with the rigamorel of setting up another IIS site
and database, I can simply add a new DNS entry and point it to my
existing IP address, add a host header in IIS, and then create the blog
in my Host Admin.

Three easy steps to a new blog.  I better be careful or I may get too
crazy with this.  A blog for every day of the week, anyone?  You know,
to color coordinate with my outfit.
