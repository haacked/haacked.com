![Spam](https://haacked.com/assets/images/spam.jpg)Lately my blog has been hit
with a torrential downpour of comment spam.  I’ve been able to fight
much of it off with some creative regular

expressions in my [ReverseDos](http://www.angrypets.com/tools/rdos/)
configuration file.  Of course keyword filtering, even Bayesian
filtering, can only go so far.  We need to supplement these approaches
with something else.

**But first, in order to combat SPAM, we need to identify the enemy.** 
Are we fighting against automated bots relentlessly crawling the web and
posting comments?  Or are these low paid humans behind the keywords? 
Are they attacking via the [Comment
API](http://wellformedweb.org/story/9 "The Comment API") or posting to
an HTML form?

My assumption has been that these are bots, but I plan to add some
diagnostics to my blog to test that assumption someday soon.  Lets run
with the assumption that the bulk of comment spam is generated by bots. 
In this case, we need to examine the behavioral differences between bots
and humans for clues in how to combat spam.

For example, an automated script can pretty much post a spam comment
instantaneously.  **What if your blog engine timed the interval between
sending out the content and receiving a comment?**If the comment came
back too quickly, then we have high confidence that it is spam.

Certainly this is easily defeated by a spammer by adding a delay, but an
artificial delay is costly to an automated script trying to hit the most
blogs possible in the shortest amount of time.  Anything to slow down
the spammers is worthwhile.

**Another potential approach is to require javascript to comment.** 
Perhaps your comment form doesn’t even exist without some javascript to
insert it in there.  The theory behind this approach is that most
automated scripts won't evaluate javascript. They simply want to post to
some form fields.  Unfortunately this hinders the accessibility of your
site for users who turn off javascript, but it may be worth the price. 
Spammers will eventually figure this one out too, but it does add a nice
computation cost to implement javascript handling in an automated
spambot.

Ultimately, these approaches are more about the behavior of the spammer
than the content.  For example, when I first started working on Subtext,
I added two features that at the time blocked a significant amount of
spam for me.  The first was to not allow duplicate comments.  I found
that a lot of comment spam simply posted the same thing over and over.

The second feature was to require a delay between comment spam
originating from the same IP address.  Using a sliding timeout of only
two minutes seemed to defuse spam bombs which would try to post a large
number of comments in a short period of time.

Later, I added ReverseDOS to help catch the spam that made it through
these approaches.  Over time, I've noticed that comment spam starts to
look more and more like legitimate messages, like the current crop of
“Nice Site!” spam. 

The one thing that every comment spam has in common is a link. 
Ultimately, the only way to stop content spam via a content-based
approach is to simply not allow any comment that contains a link in any
way shape or form.  But how awful would that be for the many legitimate
commenters who wish to share a link?

No, we must do something better. I currently don’t think we’ll ever
*win* the battle, but we can work to stay one step ahead.
