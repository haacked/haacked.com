Here’s a little trick that I didn't know about till
[Steve](http://stevenharman.net/blog/ "Steve's Blog") told me about it. 
So that’s what those other tabs in the Remote Destkop dialog are for!

[Mapping local drives to a Remote Desktop
connection](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2006/10/22/Mapping_Drives_via_Remote_Desktop.aspx "Mapping drives via Remote Desktop").

This is a handy tip to go with these others:

-   [Remote Desktop on a Non-Standard
    Port](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/17/Remote_Desktop_On_A_NonStandard_Port.aspx "Using alternate ports")
-   [Connecting To Remote Server When Active Sessions Are
    Used](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/10/13/Remote_Desktop_To_Console_Session.aspx "How to remote into the console")
