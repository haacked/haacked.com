[Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/ "Joel Spolsky") totally
nails it this time with his article on the [Developer Abstraction
Layer](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html "Insulate your developers from distractions.").
This is one of his better articles. It is a tad on the long side, but
well worth the read. Try to get it in your manager’s hands.

In summary, a development company is a lot more than the developers. In
fact, it is a huge support organization designed to remove abstractions
for the developers so they can let the magic happen. Beautiful.
