![Clover](https://haacked.com/assets/images/clover_leaf.jpg) My former neighbors
who are now in Iraq helping the reconstruction efforts [write about
their St. Patrick’s day
celebration](http://khuluma.blogspot.com/2006/03/happy-st-patricks-day_17.html "St. Patrick's Day In Iraq")
in the
[IZ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_zone "International Zone in Wikipedia"),
aka “The Compound”.

Chris and Susan used to live a few doors down and my dog Twiggy was a
huge fan of their dog Nelson. In fact, Nelson still comes by every now
and then to visit, which turns Twiggy into a little excited doggy
groupie.

My neighbors are working with
[USAID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAID "USAID in Wikipedia") and the
[Army Corps of
Engineers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Corps_of_Engineers "Army Corps of Engineers Wikipedia"),
hopefully helping to make some small good come out of a terrible
situation.

Susan finishes the post with a funny St. Paddy’s day joke.

Chris and Susan, good luck and [here’s a
joke](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2006/03/14/StPattysDayGuide.aspx "Official Guide")
right back atcha.
