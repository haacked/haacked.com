There is a lot of
[buzz](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriterAndDasBlog19.aspx "Windows Live Writer and DasBlog 1.9")
[around](http://dbvt.com/blog/archive/2006/08/14/5084.aspx "A quick tour")
Windows Live Writer.  I Might as well throw my two cents into the fray. 
Keep in mind that I do understand this is a beta.

### The Good

-   It uses the paragraph tag \<p\> around your paragraphs rather than
    \<br /\> tags.
-   Keyboard shortcuts for switching views.
-   **Integrates your blog’s style when previewing**.  This is an
    impressive feature.  When I preview the post I am working on, it
    displays the post as if it was posted on my site.  I have seen a
    *temporary blog post* with the message *This is a temporary post
    that was not deleted. Please delete this manually.
    (c3eaf4ab-0941-4881-9d17-d4f62bde069e) * in a few blogs related to
    obtaining a blog’s style. My guess is that Windows Live Writer posts
    to the blog, then deletes the post.  It takes a diff to figure out
    what changed.  That’s just my guess.
-   When adding a link, it has a field for the **rel** tag.  Nice!
-   It handles my unusual FTP setup using an FTP virtual directory. Not
    every tool deals with that correctly.
-   Inserting images allows you to apply a few simple effects. Very
    neat!
-   Support for [Really Simple Discovery
    (RSD)](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/tech/rsd.html "RSD Spec"). 
    I just added RSD to
    [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext project site").
-   Plugins!

### The Needs Improvement

Since this is a beta, I didn’t feel right calling it “The Bad”.

-   Doesn’t let you specify the **title** attribute of a tag.
-   Inserts &nbsp; all over the place as you edit text.
-   What key do I hit to **Find Next**?
-   No **Find and Replace**? Really?
-   Be nice to have HTML highlighting in the HTML View.
-   If I markup a word with the `<code>` tag, then cut and paste that
    word elsewhere in the Normal view, it marks up the pasted word with
    the font tag rather than using the underlying tag.

### The Wish

-   Using typographic characters for singe quotes and double quotes ala
    MS Word.
-   Integration with CSS styles from the blog. Be nice to have a
    pulldown for various CSS classes.
-   Configurable shortcuts. I use the \<acronym /\> and \<code /\> tag
    all the time and have shortcuts for these configured in w.bloggar.

All in all, I really like it so far.  It has a nice look and feel to it
and if they iron out a lot of these kinks, this may be the one to beat.

Unfortunately, this may cause some delays in Subtext 1.9 unless I can
fight off the vicious urge to write some
[Microformat](http://microformats.org/ "Microformats") plugins. Why must
these people introduce such interesting toys into my life! Where will I
find the time? ;)

Speaking of which, [Tim
Heuer](http://timheuer.com/blog/ "Method ~ of ~ failed") already has
written a [couple of
plugins](http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2006/08/13/13265.aspx "Enter Windows Live Writer").
