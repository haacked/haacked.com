Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central’s *The Colbert Report* is in my
opinion the funniest comedian on television right now. As
[Mugatu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196229/ "IMDB page") (played by
[Will
Ferrell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002071/ "Will Ferrell on IMDB"),
the funniest comedian in movies) would say, “It’s that damn Stephen
Colbert! He's so hot right now! Stephen Colbert.”

This clip had me rolling on the floor laughing for its spot on parody of
Dungeons and Dragons. It is probably funnier to those of us who geeked
out with D&D back in the day than for the unitiated.

After watching it, one gets the sense that he really was a player. It
turns out he is a true fan, based on this [Gamespy
