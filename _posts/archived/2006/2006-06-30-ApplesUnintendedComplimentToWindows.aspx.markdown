You’ve probably seen the recent Apple commercials with the two guys
holding hands. One introduces himself as a PC and the other introduces
himself as an Apple Macintosh. They hold hands because they speak each
other’s language. Along comes a Japanese woman representing a Japanese
digital camera who sidles up to the Mac guy and holds his hand. The Mac
speaks her language too. If you haven’t seen it, you can click on the

At the end of the commercial, she looks over at the PC guy and says
something in Japanese to the Mac guy that elicits chuckling between the
two. The inside joke is that she thinks the PC guy looks like an
*Otaku*.

Otaku refers to a specific flavor of Japanese geekdom in which the geek
is obsessed with anime, manga, action figures, and video games. In Japan
it traditionally has very negative connotations and would be considered
a pejorative. It probably has similar connotations to the term *Nerd*
back in the 80s before Nerds became rich and drove Bentleys.

However, this month’s issue of *Wired* (14.07) has a short article by
Tony McNicol that describes how this subculture has morphed into a
thriving industry and a trendy lifestyle export.

Ok, so this still isn’t necessarily a unqualified compliment, but
associating PC with becoming a hip cultural icon is probably the last
thing Apple desires. Apple is supposed to be the hip one wearing shades
in the room. Perhaps if the commercial intended to reflect modern shifts
in Japan culture, we should see the woman trying to sidle up to the PC
guy who would spurn her advances as he is too busy playing Oblivion.
