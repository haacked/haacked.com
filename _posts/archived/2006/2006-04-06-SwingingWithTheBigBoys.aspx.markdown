[Jayson](http://jaysonknight.com/blog/ "protected virtual void jaysonKnight")
emailed me to let me know that my
[PageRank](http://www.google.com/technology/ "Google Technology") is now
6. That puts me up in the ranks of the big guys like [Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "ComputerZen"). Woohoo!

You realize what this means dontcha? After all this time and hard work,
I moved from a 5 to a 6 on a 10 pt scale. It means I am no longer
flunking the blogosphere. I am getting a D baby! Woohoo! I can’t wait
for my next highschool reunion so I can shove this back in the face of
all the popular kids.

2.  Popular Kids

    > Ummm, who are you again? I don’t think you went to this school.

3.  Me

    > Oh. Umm. Right. My next reunion isn’t for another year but I

It is great to have another scale of measurement in order to bolster a
false sense of superiority and privilege over other people.

1.  Me

    > Oh, lookie lookie here. [Mr.
    > Atwood’s](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "Coding Horror")
    > PageRank is only five. Poor guy. How **does** he live with
    > himself? Maybe I’ll start a raise Atwood’s PageRank campaign.

Don’t worry, I won’t let it change this blog or myself one bit. Except
for the minor detail that in order to contact me, my contact form now
sends an email to my publicist. And if you don’t mind, please refer to
me as the blogger formerly known as Haacked.

Yes, for you humor (or English) impaired, this is satire. I am really
not that infatuated with PageRank. No really.

UPDATE: Ummm so this is kind of awkward, but Mr. Atwood points out in my
comments that his PageRank™ is actually a 6 if you put the `www.` in
front of his URL. I am afraid I must end the Raise Atwood’s PageRank™
campaign. Sorry about that Jeff. Heh Heh. No hard feelings, eh?

And I am actually sincerely glad to have a higher PageRank™. So I did
not mean this to punk Jayson in any way shape or form. The higher the
PageRank™ the more ~~AdSense Revenue~~ people I can reach with
interesting technical content.
