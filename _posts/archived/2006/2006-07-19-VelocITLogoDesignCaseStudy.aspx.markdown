![VelocIT Logo](https://haacked.com/assets/images/veloc-it_logo.gif) When we
started [VelocIT](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT"), one of the early
tasks we had was to develop an identity. Identity development is an
ongoing process that is really never over. Typically it starts with a
flurry of identity building, then it tapers off as real work takes
precedent. Every few years though, the process ramps up again as
companies reinvent themselves or freshen their “look” for the next
decade.

In our case, we had the talented [Jon
Hebert](http://www.northlinx.com/wordpress/ "Jon Hebert blog") help us
with our logo design. He [writes about the
process](http://www.northlinx.com/wordpress/?p=14 "Case Study, VelocIT Logo")
of starting with a vision and ending with a logo. I love the progression
from the rough early sketches (which look like doodles I made in sixth
grade) and ending with a logo we are all very happy with.
