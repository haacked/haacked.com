Last night we went out with friends to celebrate Akumi’s birthday.
Somehow the topic of my blog came up in conversation. Perhaps I have a
tendency to interject the topic of “blogging” every chance I get. I can
be annoying that way.

In any case, my friend Dan points out that he wishes I would write a
little more personal content. His poor eyes get tired from scrolling
down through the reams of code which is all meaningless gibberish to
him.

Well Dan, this post is for you.

Unfortunately I have nothing to say in this particular post. I slept in
late today and my day is just beginning. I have a bit of work to do for
a client so I need to get head down into coding.

In the meanwhile, for all my friends who don’t care for my technical
gibberish, you can subscribe to my *[Day to
Day](https://haacked.com/category/1.aspx "Non-Tech Category")
([rss](https://haacked.com/category/1.aspx/rss/ "Category RSS feed"))*
category. This contains all my non-technical posts 100% free of code.
