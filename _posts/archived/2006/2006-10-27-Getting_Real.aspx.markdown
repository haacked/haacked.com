Now that [37signals](http://37signals.com/ "37signals") have put their
book **[Getting Real online for
free](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php "Getting Real the Book"),
I’ve finally gotten around to start reading it. And so far, I **love
it**. I think there are a lot of great lessons, reminders, ideas in here
that will help me make products I work on that much better.

I have a premonition, even before writing this, that a lot of people
will tell me that the book is crap because they *don’t believe in
functional specifications and [even
Joel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority "Appeal to Authority")
believes in [functional
specifications](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html "Painless Functional Specifications")*.
As the authors point out in their [Caveats, disclaimers, and other
preemptive strikes
page](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch01_Caveats_disclaimers_and_other_preemptive_strikes.php "Caveats yo."),
their techniques don’t apply to everyone (though probably to more people
than one would think). Also, their ideas are not an all or nothing
affair. Gotta have your functional specs, then by all means keep doing
it. Don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater.

Open Source projects are probably in the best position to make use of
their guidelines, though I am sure many more projects would be made much
better by getting real. Subtext will most certainly gain from many of
these approaches. My hope is to use
Subtext as a
testing ground for the principles in *Getting Real*, and then using its
success to show my clients that they don’t need to be so rigid about
product development. We’ll see.

As you might guess, many of my upcoming blog posts will focus on some of
these topics.
