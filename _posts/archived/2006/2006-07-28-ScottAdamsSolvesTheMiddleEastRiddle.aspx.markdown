This is just too funny not to link to. [Scott
Adams](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/ "The Dilbert Blog"),
the author of Dilbert, [had an
epiphany](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/07/heat_wave.html "Heat Wave Epiphany")
recently which led him to solve the problems in the Middle East.

> Recently we had a heat wave in California. My air conditioner broke
> because, I assume, it is not designed to operate in hot weather. That
> was the bad news. The good news is that I solved the problems in the
> Middle East. Allow me to explain.

Please, [allow
