UPDATE: I could not slip the subtle beg for an MSDN subscription I
surreptitiously embedded in this post past my astute readers. Many
thanks to [James Avery](http://dotavery.com/blog/ ".Avery Blog") for
contributing an MSDN subscription to this grateful developer. Now that I
have my MSDN subscription, I say this whole VPC licensing thing is a
non-issue and quit whining about it. (*I joke, I joke!*).

In a [recent
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/01/Is_Backward_Compatibility_Holding_Microsoft_Back.aspx "Is Backwards Compatibility Holding MS Back?")
I declared that Virtual PC is a suitable answer to the lack of backwards
compatibility support for Visual Studio.NET 2003.  In the comments to
that post [Ryan Smith](http://www.dynamicajax.com/ "Dynamic Ajax") asks
[a
great question](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/01/Is_Backward_Compatibility_Holding_Microsoft_Back.aspx#17551 "Licensing?") surrounding
the licensing issues involved.

I think as developers, we take for granted that we are going to have
MSDN subscriptions (I used to but I don’t right now) and plenty of OS
licenses for development purposes.  But suppose I sell my old machine
and purchase a new machine with Vista installed.  How can I apply the
suggested workaround of installing Virtual PC with Windows XP if I don't
have a license to XP?

Ryan wrote Microsoft with this question and received a response that
indicated that Microsoft hasn’t quite figured this out. Does this mean
that developers need to shell out another \$189 or so in order to
develop with Visual Studio.NET 2003 in a Virtual PC running Windows
XP on Vista?
