From the 37 Signals blog I find out that [reflections are the new
dropshadows](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/reflections_are_the_new_drop_shadows.php). 
Unfortunately I didn’t get the memo, but at least there is a nice simple
javascript library to [add
reflections](http://cow.neondragon.net/stuff/reflection/) to images.

How long will it take someone to write a Windows Live Writer plugin to
do the same?

So if it is working correctly, the image here should have a reflection.

UPDATE: Doesn’t seem to align quite right for me in Firefox, but looks
great in IE.

Don’t you love jumping in on the latest fad? What will be next?
BlackVelvet.js?
