I have been looking [for
this](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/06/01/The-easiest-way-to-see-your-site-in-IE7-and-Safari.aspx "The easy way to view in Safari or IE 7")
for a looong time.

[Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway") writes
about two sites created by [Dan Vine](http://danvine.com/ "Dan Vine")
that allow you to enter an URL and it will display a screenshot of the
website as rendered by IE7 or Safari. This is extremely useful for
testing out web designs on alternate platform. Much cheaper than buying
a Mac to test your work on Safari browsers.

I also want to commend Dan for such clean design. Each site is like a
well written function. It does one thing and it does it well. A joy to
use really.

One thing to note, iCapture produces a screenshot of the entire page,
potentially producing a tall image. At the time of this writing,
ieCapture takes a screenshot of the actual browser window, which doesn’t
show the entire document.
