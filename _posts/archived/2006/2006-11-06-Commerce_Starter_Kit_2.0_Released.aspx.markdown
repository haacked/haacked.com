[Rob Conery](http://www.wekeroad.com/blogs/ "Rob Conery") just announced
the [2.0 release of the Commerce Starter
Kit](http://www.wekeroad.com/blogs/PermaLink,guid,8ae71e7c-dd92-4015-b1a8-093ebc0b853e.aspx "CSK 2.0 Is Launched, And a Dedication").
If you are planning to build a commerce site, it is well worth checking
out as it is a full featured modular application built on top of ASP.NET
2.0 and Subsonic.

I know Rob and his team worked hard to get this release ready and Rob
especially has poured his heart and soul into the project, building a
thriving community around it in that time.  Congratulations to everyone
involved!

This good news is tempered by the news that Rob’s father passed away
recently.  The announcement of the CSK release includes a heartfelt
dedication to his father. I wish you and your family well Rob.
