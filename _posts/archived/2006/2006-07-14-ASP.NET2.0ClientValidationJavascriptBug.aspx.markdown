![Bug](https://haacked.com/assets/images/554589_beetle.jpg) I recently ran into
a perplexing problem that I believe is a bug in ASP.NET 2.0.

Subtext dynamically loads UserControls into the page when fulfilling a
request. When commenting on a post, we load a user control that contains
the comment form fields and some instances of the
`RequiredFieldValidator` validation control.

While testing, I noticed I kept getting javascript errors when trying to
post a comment. Here is the error message:

> missing ; before statement

Viewing the source, I noticed the error occurs in the javascript
generated by the ASP.NET runtime for client side validation. Here is a
tiny snippet of the line with the problem.

```csharp
var ControlWithValidators.ascx_validateThat = document.all ? ...
```

Notice the problem? There is a dot in the variable name that Javascript
does not like since `ControlWithValidators` is not an object. What the?

After some digging around I found the culprit. I won’t bore you with the
nitty gritty details. When dynamically adding controls to a page, it is
a good idea to specify an id before adding them to the `Controls`
collection. That way the controls can reload their state on Postback.
However the snippet of code I found was giving the controls an ID that
contained a period.

To prove this was indeed the culprit, I created a new simple VS.NET 2005
Web Application Project that exhibits the bug. The page dynamically
loads a user control that contains a validation control. Here is the
`Page_Load` method of the web page. When you compile this and run the
page, you will see the javascript error.

```csharp
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Control control = LoadControl("ControlWithValidators.ascx");
    control.ID = "ControlWithValidators.ascx";
    placeholder.Controls.Add(control);
}
```

The quick fix was to simply replace the period with an underscore when
assigning the id. Hopefully this helps you if you ever run into
something so obscure.

If you are interested in duplicating the bug, you can download the

this kind of thing?
