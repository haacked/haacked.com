For whatever reasons, I happen to be somewhat well endowed in the
forehead region.  My wife (bless her heart) likes to refer my
forehead as my *Sandwich Compartment*.

She jokes that I can keep a sandwich in there, maybe even a soda.  When
she says this, she mimics the motion of opening up my forehead like a
cooler and reaching in to grab a nice delicious sandwich.

A while ago we were talking about .NET bloggers in general because we
just had dinner with [Jeff Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/blog/).  I
showed her [Scott Hanselman’s](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) blog as
an example of a *really really* popular .NET blog.  She remarked,

> Well he must be smart!  His forehead is even bigger than yours!

See for yourself with these comparison photos.

Ready for a picnic

I told this story to Scott today via Skype and he confided in me that
someone once referred to his forehead as his **fivehead**.

If I had been drinking a Coke at that point, it would have been snorted
all over my keyboard.  Many thanks to Scott for allowing me to share
this story, albeit grudgingly. ;)
