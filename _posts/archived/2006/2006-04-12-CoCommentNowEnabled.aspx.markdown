![CoComment Logo](https://haacked.com/assets/images/cocommentlogo.gif) My blog
now supports
[CoComment](http://cocomment.com/ "Comment Tracking System") tracking.
Let me know if you run into any problems with posting comments.

As I [mentioned
earlier](/archive/2006/04/04/CoCommentSupportInSubtext.aspx "CoComment Support In Subtext"),
I added CoComment to Subtext as an administrative option. I am running
the latest build from our Subversion repository. What better way to hash
out bugs than to dogfood your own code. And man, was I eating some chow
last night and this morning. I think I teased out most of the pressing
bugs and my blog is pretty stable right now. Whew!

I performed a live test of automatically upgrading the schema and stored
procs via the new web-based upgrade wizard in Subtext. That was really
cool. When I was done, it looked like all my blog posts were gone. I
nearly splattered my eyes on the monitors. But that was simply a UI
glitch caused by hitting the site while files were still being copied
over.
