![Vista](https://haacked.com/assets/images/WindowsVista.jpg) From reading other
blogs, it seems many developers are unimpressed with the sheen of
Windows Vista, the next version of the Microsoft operating system. There
is definitely appreciation for all the improvements under the hood, but
the out-of-box experience (at least in the betas), leaves much to be
desired.

from Jon Galloway that first points to some videos that compare Vista to
Mac OSX (released 2002). He then lists several ways that Microsoft could
inexpensively do better. My favorite quote is this...
