[Greg
Duncan](http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/2006/06/satisfy-your-80s-music-video-fix.html "Greg Duncan")
is now my hero for [this
find](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/ "80s Music Videos"). This just
proves that I am still unable to let go of the 80s.

Unfortunately, some of the *flagship* songs of certain groups are
missing in place of other videos. For example, instead of *Pour Some
Sugar* from Def Leppard we get *Photograph*. Likewise where is
*Loveshack* from the B52s?

Some notable videos (both good and bad):

- [Club Nouveau - Lean on
  Me](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=4ilWMYifVlc "Lean on Me")
  - Quite possibly my favorite song of the 80s for some reason.
- [U2 - With or Without
  You](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=li99qCf100w "With or Without You")
  - My Other Favorite Song of the 80s.
- [Debarge - Rhythm of the
  Night](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=iBwXKSNue6A "Rhythm")
  - Just look at this guy. But admit that you liked the song, just not
  in public.
- [Def Leppard -
  Photograph](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=GBi2P9VCqMs "Photograph")
  - It isn’t *Pour Some Sugar* but it is still Def Leppard! Recognize!
- [Public Enemy - Don’t Believe the
  Hype](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=2bT_JW-eseQ "Don’t Believe The Hype")
  - Flavor Flav took time pieces to the next level.
- [MC Hammer - U Can’t Touch
  This](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=nG8k8Py9IPI "You Can’t Touch This")
  - Please Hammer, don’t hurt them. Please.
- [Metallica - Master of
  Puppets](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=ToNRGFETLqY "Master of Puppets")
  - Biggest Metal Band in History.
- [Depeche Mode - Just Can’t Get
  Enough](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=dIuIHqRAbxI "Just Can’t Get Enough")
  - Well I agree. I just can’t enough.
- [Bangles - Walk Like An
  Egyptian](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=bdRaLuKhobU "Walk Like An Egyptian")
  - Who didn’t have a crush on the lead singer?

There are too many to list.
