I know what you’re probably thinking. *Did Phil forget to take his meds
today?* Let me explain.

Yesterday I thought I would try my hand at upgrading to Vista. But
first, being the conscientious geek that I am, I tried to mirror my
current drive to a brand new drive.

I plopped the new drive carefully (as carefully as one can *plop*
anything) into the machine, and the system wouldn’t boot. So I
retreated, pulling the old drive out and putting everything back the way
it was.

Or so I thought.

The machine still wouldn’t boot. I ran the entire suite of Dell
diagnostics tests on it. I also ran CHKDSK /F on it. Nothing. I ran out
and bought a new SATA cable. Nothing. As far as any software test could
tell, the drive was fine. It was being recognized by the BIOS, it just
wouldn’t boot.

I plopped my new drive (again carefully) into the primary spot and was
able to perform a clean install on it. So my machine can boot on my new
drive with Vista, but not my old drive with Windows XP. How strange! At
least I can access my old drive from Vista in order to copy important
files over to the new drive.

As an aside, why do we say we *perform* installs? It’s not like anyone
is watching, nor would they really want to. Who is being entertained?

Today, I was still dealing with the aftermath of this drive failure when
I chatted up Micah on Skype. He remarked that everyone in our company
seems to be having computer issues
today. [Jon’s](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway") having
problems with his sound card, Pat misplaced his laptop, and Micah’s USB
flash-drive failed. He says,

> Must be something in the air. Maybe there was a huge solar flare or
> something.

Then it struck me.

I remembered reading that in fact there is a [huge solar flare headed
towards
Earth](http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/12/13/solar.storm/ "Solar Storm").
Well there you go, say no more. That explains it. A solar flare hosed my
drive. Right now I am trying to mirror my new drive over my old drive to
see if it’ll boot up with Vista. If it does, then it would seem to me
that somehow Windows got corrupted on my old drive. Perhaps a solar
particle flipped the `AllowBootAndJustWork` bit to 0. Just my luck.

In any case, it’s a good thing I have a couple of backup machines to
blog from.
