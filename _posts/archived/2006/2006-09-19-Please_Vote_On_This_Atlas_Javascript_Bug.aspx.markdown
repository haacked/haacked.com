UPDATE: Looks like this will get fixed in the next release according to
a comment on Steve’s blog.

[Steve Harman](http://stevenharman.net/blog/), a
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/) developer, was prototyping using
Atlas in Subtext and encountered a rather problematic bug.

Not only did he encounter the bug, he went through the hard work to dig
into the source of the bug right [down to the line of
code](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2006/08/04/The_ATLAS_Framework__Callback_Handler_JavaScript_Bug.aspx#feedback)
and proposes a fix.  How is that for constructive criticism?

Unfortunately, he [hasn't received any
response](http://forums.asp.net/thread/1358123.aspx) from the Atlas team
(at the time of this posting) regarding whether or not they recognize
this as a bug and if they will fix it.  He subsequently filed an
official bug report at [Microsoft
Connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/).

This is not some arcane bug, so you may get bit by it as well if you use
any browser extension such as CoComment with Atlas.
