![Subtext Logo](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SubtextLogo.png) [Steve
Harman](http://stevenharman.net/blog/ "Steve's Blog") reports that
[Subtext reached 1000
downloads](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2006/04/10/SubTextReaches1000DownloadsAndCounting.aspx "Subtext reaches 1000")
just recently on SourceForge.

That is pretty sweet news. I sort of wish we added some code that asked
permission to ping us when someone installs
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Site"), but as you
can imagine that would be very low on the totem pole of requirements.

We are getting close to a bug fix release that contains some extra
goodies. I will set a release date soon. I have just been overwhelmed
with work and other events.
