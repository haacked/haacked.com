drinking water piped to my house is something I take for granted (*yes,
even in Los Angeles)*. When I stop to think about it a bit, I can’t
imagine how tough it must be to not have clean drinking water.

For people in four remote areas of Malawi, this is a day to day reality.
Fortunately, there are people trying to do something about it. [Wells
for Zoë](http://www.wellsforzoe.org/ "The Charity’s Website") is a
charity dedicated to bringing clean water to these areas.

[Jamie
Cansdale](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/ "Jamie Cansdale’s Blog"),
famous for [TestDriven.NET](http://testdriven.net/ "TestDriven.NET") (a
tool [near and dear to my
heart](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/12/14/Indulging_My_OCD_Using_TestDriven.NET_With_NCoverExplorer.aspx "Indulging my unit testing OCD")),
is doing his part to contribute to this good cause by starting a [.NET
software charity
auction](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2006/12/14/net-developer-software-charity-auction.aspx "Charity Auction").
Several generous vendors have donated licenses to great software you can
bid on. If you have the means, consider making a bid. If not, perhaps
you can make a small [direct
donation](http://www.wellsforzoe.org/donations.htm "Donation").
