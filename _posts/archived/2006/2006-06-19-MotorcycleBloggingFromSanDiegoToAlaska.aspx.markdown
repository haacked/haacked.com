This is the [blog of a
chap](http://carotidbattery.com/ "Carotid Battery") who is riding a
teched out motorcycle computer (which he calls his “motocompy”) from San
Diego to my homestate Alaska. I helped him get his
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext") blog setup so he can
blog the entire trip.

His rig is tricked out with Wi-F, a webcam, a mini-ITX system with DVD
Player, a power inverter, GPS, a 7" touch-screen, etc... stored in a
tank bag attached to his bike via magnets.

Check out this [blog
post](http://carotidbattery.com/archive/2006/06/10/MeetMotocompy.aspx "Meet Motocompy")
to see a couple videos where he describes his setup.

He also happens to be my coworker’s ([Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway")) brother.
