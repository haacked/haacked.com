This is a [pretty sweet
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZNTgglPbUA&eurl= "MIT Sketching")
that demonstrates a system for sketching on a whiteboard using
mimio-like projection system.  The instructor draws objects, adds a
gravity vector, and then animates his drawings to see the result.

Another interesting take on user interfaces for industrial design.
