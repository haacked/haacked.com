Here’s wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy Holidays. For
Christmas, I received a defective video card as a warranty replacement
for my defective video card. Thanks Dell! The replacement card was
**more** defective than the one I returned.

Unfortunately this means I can't work on my book until I get it
replaced. On the plus side, I have more time to spend with my visiting
family.

Tonight, we have our annual Alaska King Crab Christmas dinner. I’ll post
pics later.
