![Mud Bath](https://haacked.com/assets/images/Mud.jpg)My wife received a free
day at the [Glen Ivy Hot Springs
Spa](http://www.glenivy.com/ "Glen Ivy") from our friends Dan and Judy
(the same Dan to whom my [last non-geek
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/05/28/ThisOneIsForYouDan.aspx "This one is for you Dan")
was dedicated).

So the four of us headed over there yesterday for a day of relaxation.
The day consisted of sitting in a stinky hot sulfur mineral jacuzzi
bath, then swimming in the pool, taking a nap, eating lunch, and finally
covering ourselves from head to toe in mud.

I was a little too aggressive in covering myself in mud, slathering it
on and getting plenty of it in my eyes. I didn’t pay attention to the
memo to rub it **around** the eyes and not **in** the eyes. You don’t
say!

I remember as a kid always being admonished about getting too muddy when
playing outside. Now as an adult, I pay for the experience. Must be some
form of latent rebellion.
