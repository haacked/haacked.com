As you may well know, today is June 6, 2006 or in shorthand notation
6/6/06, the mark of the beast. As the church lady would say, “mmmmm,
isn’t that special?”

This day reminds me of a song I heard a loooong time ago called “Sweat
Loaf” by the Butthole Surfers (pleasant name). It starts off with a nice
conversation between an all American boy and his all American dad.

1.  Son

    > Daddy?

2.  Dad

    > Yes, son?

3.  Son

    > What does regret mean?

4.  Dad

    > Well a funny thing about regret is, its better to regret something
    > you have done, then to regret something you haven't done....Oh and
    > if you see your mother this weekend remember to tell her- **SATAN,
    > SATAN, SATAN**

So in commemoration of this numerologically significant day, be sure to
show the evil horns gesture to somebody today and include a little head
banging. Our President will lead us with a showing of the horns.
