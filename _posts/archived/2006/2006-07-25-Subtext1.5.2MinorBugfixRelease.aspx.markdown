![Subtext Logo](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SubtextLogo.png) The Subtext
team is currently furiously working to prepare the Subtext 1.9
*Daedelus* release for your blogging enjoyment. Subtext 1.9 will run on
ASP.NET 2.0 in Medium trust and contain a few new goodies, though those
goodies have been kept to a minimum as the goal was to create a straight
port to ASP.NET 2.0. The release date has not been set since [my day
job](http://veloc-it.com/ "My Employer") and another minor side project
has been keeping me busy. My hope is to release somewhere around the
first or second week of August.

In the meanwhile, we found the need to respond to some minor bugs in the
last release. Thus today we release Subtext 1.5.2 which still runs on
ASP.NET 1.1. This is a very minor release, so probably not necessary
unless you are affected by one of the bugs listed below.

Probably the most annoying bug was one that caused problems when
attempting to create a post using the web-based admin tool. This was due
to a misconfiguration on my part of our
[ReverseDOS](http://www.angrypets.com/tools/rdos/ "Reverse DOS")
configuration file.

It was this misconfiguration that inspired my “[stroke of pure
genius](http://blog.angrypets.com/2006/07/reversedos_the_.html "ReverseDos The Next Generation")”
suggestion to the [creator of
ReverseDOS](http://blog.angrypets.com/ "AngryPets") (though methinks he
is a bit strong on the compliment). ;)

Here are the release notes.

    Version 1.5.2 - Bugfix Release
    - BUG:  [1492127] Fixed a constraint on the 
                      subtext_Config.BlogGroup in the import  
                      script.
    - BUG:  [1524172] The User Name Is Being Saved as the Title

    - BUG:  [1514406] Fixed bug in which permissions were not 
                      applied to [Subtext_GetEntry_PreviousNext] stored 
                      procedure.
