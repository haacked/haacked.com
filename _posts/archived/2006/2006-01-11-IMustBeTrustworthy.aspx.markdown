[interesting
write-up](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/01/11/435076.aspx)
on the latest changes to Google’s search algorithms code named “Jagger”

The short and sweet summary is that rather than letting websites “vote”
on a page’s relevancy with a link, the trustworthiness of a page is
taken into account. For example, a site that has been around longer is
potentially considered more trustworthy (assuming it meets other
criteria). A page that has incoming links from trustworthy sources is
itself more trustworthy.

I had always thought that this was how the PageRank algorithm worked all
along. After all, the Google boys original inspiration was the network
of citations in academic papers and texts. A citation from a well-cited
and trustworthy source boosted the respectability of the cited paper,
whereas a citation from a nobody, didn’t account for much.

In the end, I am pretty happy about these changes as my ad-sense revenue
has increased lately.
