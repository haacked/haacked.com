My goodness. Today is Open Source News Day for me.

I just read the sad news that Kevin Downs, the leader of the NDoc
project, [announced that NDoc 2 Is Officially
Dead](http://www.charliedigital.com/PermaLink,guid,95b2ab68-ba92-413a-b758-2783cde5df9c.aspx "NDoc Is Dead").
[NDoc](http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/ "NDoc") is a wonderfully useful tool
for generating nicely formatted CHM and HTML documentation from XML
comments within your source code.

What is really troubling about the news is the attitude by some members
of the community that was a contributing factor to Kevin calling it
quits.

I cannot understand the mentality of someone who *demands* for
developers to *hurry up* and release a new version of a free software
product. If you are in such dire need of the new version, why not *hurry
up* and contribute?

Having said that, I feel particularly bad that I never contributed to
NDoc, yet enjoyed so much use out of it. As the manager of an open
source project myself, I understand the inherent difficulty in
generating interest and contributions from the community at large.

In general, I try to contribute to Open Source projects when I can. I
have contributed a tiny bit of money and some documentation and code to
[RSS Bandit](http://www.rssbandit.org/ "RSS Bandit"), I [bought a domain
name](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/06/05/IntroducingMBUnit.com.aspx "Introducing MbUnit.com")
for [MbUnit](http://mbunit.com/ "MbUnit"), and of course I contribute to
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext"). But I realized today
that I am quite haphazard in how I contribute to useful open source
projects. I contribute to some when the mood strikes, but not others.

### Challenge

So I offer the following challenge. First, ask yourself these two
questions:

1.  **How much money do I save because of Open Source Software?**
2.  **Considering how many people spend three bucks for a useless ring
    tone, is a single dollar too much to contribute to a useful Open
    Source project?**

So let’s ban together and declare today, July 26, 2006, **Contribute To
Open Source Day**. Look at the open source software you use and consider
making a tiny contribution to the project if you find it useful. The
contribution could be a small monetary contribution such as a buck (or
five). Even more valuable is contributing a single bug fix. If you want
to contribute to Subtext, consider writing a Unit Test to cover a case
that isn’t tested. What better way to learn about writing unit tests?

Gee, using [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/ "GIMP") alone saves me a few
hundred that I would otherwise pay for Photoshop. My goal now is to at
least contribute something everytime I download a new open source
product, whether it be some useful bug reports or feedback, a bug fix, a
buck...anything. Just as long as it is something.

I will check back with you next year on July 26 and remind you again to
consider contributing. It is worth it.
