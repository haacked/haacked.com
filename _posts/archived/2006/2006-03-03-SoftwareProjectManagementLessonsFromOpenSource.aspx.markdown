[Via
Slashdot](http://rss.slashdot.org/slashdot/eqWf?m=3999 "Slashdot Post"),
I recently read an article entitled [What Corporate Projects Should
Learn From Open
Source](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/02/27/what-corp-projects-learn-from-open-source.html "Article on open source software management")
by Andrew Stellman and Jennifer Greene.

This article is a wonderful complement to the book on managing open
source projects I [mentioned
recently](/archive/2006/01/16/RunningAnOpenSourceProject.aspx "Running An Open Source Project")
as it focuses on what corporated projects can learn from successful open
source projects.

Among many factors, one key factor they discuss is how the lack of
strict hierarchy and transparency in an open source community is a key
component to an OS project’s success.

Features and changes cannot simply be added or changed on the whim of
some VP who has no clue about how software development works and is
unwilling to expose his or her reasoning. If someone proposes a big
change, it gets discussed and weighed on its merits in an open forum.
The marketing team does not drive the schedule in an open source
project.

Another striking quality of successful open source projects is that
despite the tendency towards an agile approach to development, they are
at the same time very disciplined. Every project profiled had fairly
well documented and detailed rules about the procedure for committing
code, how a release is packaged, how a bug is triaged, etc...

I believe this turns the notion that open source projects are
undisciplined chaotic bucket of bolts endeavors while commercial
projects are finely tuned tightly run machines on its head. In fact, it
is the commercial projects that could stand a bit more discipline.

Unfortunately, I believe that some of these lessons may never reach the
right ears, as pride and arrogance tends to bring about the downfall of
many a corporate project.

In any case, I encourage you to read it and sneak it under the door of
the stakeholders of your various projects.
