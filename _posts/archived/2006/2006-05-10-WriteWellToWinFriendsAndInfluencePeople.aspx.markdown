![Pen](https://haacked.com/assets/images/FountainPen.jpg) I write this blog post
with apologies to [Dale
Carnegie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie "Dale Carnegie")
for the play on the title of his book.

Today, [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "CodingHorror")
writes about the difference between [writing and
copywriting](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000585.html "Power, Influnce, and Copyrwriting").
His essential point is that good copyrighting is *marketing* and is
boring. Good *writing* on the other hand is engaging and *not* boring.
Understand the difference?

I think this dovetails nicely into another article I read recently at [A
List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/ "Great site for web design")
entitled [Calling All Designers: Learn to
Write!](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/learntowrite "Article on writing")

Derek Powazek points out that creating a good user experience goes
beyond rounded corners and visual design. Good writing is an essential
part of creating a great user experience. He sites
[Flickr](http://flickr.com/ "Flickr Photo Sharing") as one example of
getting it right. Rather than a button that says *Submit* they have a
button that says *Get in there*. That really is friendlier isn’t it.

When you think about it, using plain casual English is much more natural
for people to read. How often in the real-world do you hear people
asking you to *submit* anything except when submitting a drug test or
tax forms in triplicate?

So I took a look at my blog and noticed that in the front end, there is
pretty much only one button that people use on a daily basis and it said
*Comment*. So I changed it to *Leave Your Mark* and sat back waiting for
the accolades to roll in on the improved user experience. Anybody hear
crickets?

Well it is going to take more than changing a single button to improve
the overall user experience here. I will actually have to start writing
well and quit using this random copy generator. But these are definitely
insights I want to take into consideration when I get around to tweaking
and updating the admin interface to
Subtext. What
are areas in which we can improve the writing? How can we improve the
user experience? Little touches add up to a lot in creating a great
experience.
