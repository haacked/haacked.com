[Scott
Mitchell](http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/ "Scott On Writing Blog")
reminisces about [Websites Back in the
Day](http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/posts/4924.aspx "Websites Back In the Day").
You mean like [this
one](http://web.utk.edu/~gwhitney/awful/awful2.html "Awful Web Design")^1^
Scott?

^1^ Creds to [Mr. CodingHorror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) for
finding this lovely lovely website that proves just because you can
publish on the web, doesn’t mean you should. (Note: I do understand that
particular site is satire, but I remember when that seemed to be the
norm.)
