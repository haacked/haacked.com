![World Cup Widow](https://haacked.com/assets/images/WorldCupWidows.jpg) Leading
up to the world cup there was a lot of attention to how the World Cup
would affect the wives of ~~soccer~~ football crazy men. Some were on
the humorous side such as this [list of rules for
women](http://www.boreme.com/boreme/funny-2006/world-cup-rules-p1.php "List of Rules"),
while others attempt to help women [avoid becoming a world cup
widow](http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&id=8512 "Avoid becoming a world cup widow").

Fortunately for me, my wife enjoys watching the world cup. What’s not to
like with such pretty boys as Beckham, Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo on the
pitch? The real widow appears to be my blog. As I pass by the office on
the way to the television, I can hear her whimper, “Another day of
neglect. I understand. Go on. Don’t worry about me.”

I figured I would spare the world of yet another person’s biased and
uninformed opinion on the events of the World Cup. But today I thought I
would take a few moments to say something.

I had the good fortune to go in for jury duty this past Thursday. It was
*good* fortune because I was not called into a trial so I was able to
sit back and watch a couple World Cup with other dedicated soccer fans.
When the noon lunch break came, everybody left except for a few of us
who had pizza delivered to the courthouse.

Today I enjoyed the Brazil win and will watch Korea play France next.
Heavily favored Brazil is not looking so heavily favored so far. Unless
they pick up their play, I think Argentina is the team to beat. Ghana
looked wonderful against the Czech Republic. The U.S. is going to have
their work cut out for them. They will be very lucky if they advance. At
least they showed some grit against Italy.
