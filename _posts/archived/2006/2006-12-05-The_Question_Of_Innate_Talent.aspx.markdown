Recently while picking up a few items at Target, I decided to buy a
cheapo soccer ball. Now those who know me know I’m a bit of a fanatic
about playing soccer, willingly paying good money for a quality ball.

But this ball is not for playing outdoors. I keep it in my office so I
can dribble it during breaks, deftly avoiding obstacles on my way to the
bathroom, practicing moves during phone calls and long compilations.

It’s a minor thing, but I am already noticing improvement when playing
for real, just through the benefits of visualization and practice. I
wouldn’t recommend this for every sport. Images of [Craig
Andera](http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/default.aspx "Craig")
with a hockey stick breaking furniture in his office come to mind.

As software developers, we tend to hold the idea of *innate talent* in
very high regard. How often do you hear software pundits saying, *Either
you got it, or you don’t*.

However, according to a recent [Scientific
American](http://scientificamerican.com/ "Scientific American") article,
[The Expert
Mind](http://scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleID=00010347-101C-14C1-8F9E83414B7F4945 "The Expert Mind"), this
may not be as much the case as we think.

The article delves into studies of chessmasters who when briefly shown a
random chessboard cannot recall the positions of its pieces any better
than non-chessmasters, but when those pieces represent possible
configurations due to game play, have a significantly stronger recall.

The article concludes that chessmasters build structures in their brains
to recognize patterns in chess, and that to become an expert in chess
takes around ten years.

It turns out that the quality of effortful study is a big factor in
moving from novice to expert. So not everyone will become an expert in
10 years, only those who continue to push themselves, examine their
weaknesses and strengths, and study accordingly.

I figured I could move past my plateau as a soccer player by creating
ways to practice better and more often, hence the soccer ball in my
office.

I think the lesson for software developers who wish to keep on top of
their game and become experts is to keep exercising the mind via
effortful studying. I read a lot technical books, but many of them
aren’t making me better as a developer. I pretty much read books on
autopilot these days.

**It’s not till I actually spend time to think about the implications
and applications for concepts in the books, explain these concepts to
others, and write code to test my understanding out, that I really feel
growth in my craft.**

Of course, that leaves me with the question of whether some people are
innately more curious or better at studying and finding ways to improve
themselves, but that’s a question for the researchers to work on.

If you haven’t already, I recommend [reading the
article](http://scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleID=00010347-101C-14C1-8F9E83414B7F4945 "The Expert Mind"),
because my summary does not do it justice.
