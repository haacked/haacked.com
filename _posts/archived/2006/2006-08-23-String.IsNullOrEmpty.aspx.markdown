This post is an ode to one of my favorite, albeit extremely minor,
additions to .NET 2.0.  This is the method that I am sure we have all
written in some sort of StringHelper library of some sort, but are now
glad it is included in the framework as it makes our code a tad bit
cleaner and shuts up that pesky FxCop warning about using the length of
the string to test for empty strings.

And under the hood, it does the right thing.

```csharp
public static bool IsNullOrEmpty(string value)
{
      if (value != null)
      {
            return (value.Length == 0);
      }
      return true;
}
```

If you haven’t met this method, do get well acquainted.
