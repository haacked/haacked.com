A friend of mine sent me an [interesting
report](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20061005005653&newsLang=en "Report")
that Brad Greenspan, the founder of eUniverse (now Intermix Media) that
created and owned MySpace.com issued an [online
report](http://freemyspace.com/Free_Myspace_Report.htm "The Myspace report")
that the sale of MySpace intentionally defrauded shareholders out of
multiple billions of dollars because they hid MySpace revenues from
shareholders.

*Disclosure: Technically, I used to work for Intermix Media as they
owned my last employer, SkillJam, before SkillJam was sold to Fun
technologies.*

The most surprising bit to me is that (according to the report)

> Shareholders were not aware that Myspace’s revenue was growing at a
> 1200 percent annualized rate and increasing.

I wonder how much of this is true.  If it is true, what happens next? 
Gotta love the smell of scandal in the morning.
