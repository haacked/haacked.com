Great show on [.NET
Rocks](http://dotnetrocks.com/ "Rob Conery on DotNetRocks") today
featuring [Rob
Conery](http://www.wekeroad.com/blogs/ "Rob Conery Ramblings"),
architect of the [Commerce Starter
Kit](http://www.commercestarterkit.org/ "CSK 2.0") and
[SubSonic](http://codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=actionpack "The Zero Code DAL").

However, being the self-centered person that I am, the only thing I
remember hearing is my last name being mispronounced.

For the record, my last name is “Haack” which is pronounced *Hack*, as
in,

> Yeah, I took a look at the new code Phil put into Subtext.  Talk about
> an ugly Haack!

On the show Rob pronounced it *Hock* which is only okay if you are
British, which Rob is not.  I already gave Rob crap about it, so we’re
cool. ![Wink](https://haacked.com/assets/images/emotions/smiley-wink.gif)
