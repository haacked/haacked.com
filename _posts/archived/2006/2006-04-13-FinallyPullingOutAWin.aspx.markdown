So after a few humiliating losses (in both soccer leagues I play in), we
finally have a convincing win last night (5 to 2) in the Olympic league
(the more competitive one). I even had a goal off of a dangerous cross
that the defender tried to stop, but ended up deflecting it into the
goal.

Hey, I’ll take what I can get.
