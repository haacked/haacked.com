Interesting post on how easy it is to [open up a Diebold voting
machine](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1064).  Security is not
realized by trusting the words of some CEO.  Security is obtained via
peer review and testing.

Even then, real Security is [never fully
obtained](http://www.engadget.com/2004/09/14/kryptonite-evolution-2000-u-lock-hacked-by-a-bic-pen/).
It is always a matter of degrees.  In this particular case, the
thermostat is turned down really really low.
