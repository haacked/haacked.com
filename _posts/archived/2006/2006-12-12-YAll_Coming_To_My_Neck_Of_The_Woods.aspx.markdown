According to Brad Abrams, it looks like we’re going to have us another
PDC [in 2007](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/ "PDC 2007"). For
those of you not in the know, PDC stands for Professional Developer
Conference. These are conferences in which Microsoft shows off upcoming
technologies that us developers will be using.

It’s not till October 2, so there’s still time to scrounge up the money

Maine*](http://hyperthink.net/blog/ "Steve Main's Brain.Save()")*can

I probably know a back door or two I can sneak through if it comes to
that. I’m looking forward to having all you illustrious developers in my
neighborhood (*Westside!*). It’s too early for a roll call, but be sure
that I hear about it when you decide to attend.
