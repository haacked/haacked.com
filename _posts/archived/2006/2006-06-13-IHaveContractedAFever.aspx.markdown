![Soccer Ball](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SoccerBallBW.jpg)**World Cup
Fever!**.

Hence the lack of blogging. Last weekend, I went on a camping trip with
my coworkers [Micah](http://micahdylan.com/ "Micah Dylan") and
[Jon](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway") in the Los
Padres national forest. I was fighting a bad cold at the time and am
only now getting over it.

But a new fever has taken its place. In part, I was feeling pukey after
the horrible showing by the U.S. against the Czech Republic. The only
bright side to that game was the play of Oguchi Onyewu and Claudio
Reyna.

Today during lunch I will watch Brazil play the beautiful game. Since I
don’t have cable I will have to watch it on Univision (a former
employer) and brush up on my Spanish. At least I know what
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL means!
