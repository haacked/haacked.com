That is a fine question in need of a good answer.  The answer for
implementors is easily found in [the
spec](http://http//archipelago.phrasewise.com/display?page=oldsite/1330.html/ "RFC: Really Simple Discovery 1.0"). 
For the rest of us there is the exceedingly [sparse
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Simple_Discovery "RSD on Wikipedia")
(at the time of this writing) in
[Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.com/ "Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia").

That entry is somewhat pathetic at the moment. I mean who wrote that
crap?! Hmmm.. Well taking a look at the history... I see that the
perpetrator was...oh! me.

Well I am sure one of you can do a much better job than I did of
elaborating on the topic.
