I learned that the video was leaked to YouTube prior to its world
premier and has been taken down. You can find the song on [Weird Al’s
MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/weirdal). I’ve updated my link.

This video from Weird Al Yankovich cracks me up with such lyrical gems
like this:

> The only question
> I ever thought was hard.
> Is do I like Kirk?
> Or do I like Picard?

Mad props to Al whose flow could give Eminem a run for his money.  Click
on the image to watch the video on YouTube. Beware, the tune is catchy
and you might catch yourself singing it later.
