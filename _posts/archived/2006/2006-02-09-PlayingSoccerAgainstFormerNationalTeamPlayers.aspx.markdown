![Soccer Ball](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SoccerBallBW.jpg) I’ve joined a
group of soccer players attempting to form a team to get into a 30 and
over league that hosts games on much nicer fields. These are the fields
with that really nice high quality artificial turf, a huge difference
over the pock-marked dirt/grass fields of my current league. The play in
this league is also at a much higher level than my current league and
they are very particular about which teams they let in. They judge teams
on ability, sportsmanship, and organization.

Last night we played one of their top teams, if not the top. This team
included an ex-Sweden national team player and an ex-MLS/National Team
player. Had I known I would have asked for autographs. ;)

For one of their warm-ups, these guys we're in tight circles of five
conducting a one-touch five man weave. The interesting part was that it
was one-touch in the air. The ball didn’t touch the ground. Meanwhile we
looked like the Bad News Bears with our mismatched jerseys. This was one
of several friendlies so that the league could evaluate us, so we don’t
have uniforms yet.

In any case, we struck first with a goal and ended up with a one to one
tie. A very respectable showing, but between me and you, and I would
never admit this normally, but they were a much better team. It was
obvious they’ve played together for a long time. It is amazing what a
well organized, well coordinated team can do. Just like software teams!

Not only that, every last one of them was fit like Lance Armstrong. This
was one of the few games I subbed myself out from time to time to get a
breather. Usually you have to drag me kicking and screaming off the
field.

In any case, we just got the word that we have been accepted into the
league. Woohoo! Hopefully we won’t run [into any

in this league.
