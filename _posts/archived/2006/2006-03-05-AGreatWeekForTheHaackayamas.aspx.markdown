This past week was a particularly good week and weekend for me and my
wife. First of all, I was happy to announce [the release of
Subtext](/archive/2006/03/02/Subtext1.0NautilusEditionReleased.aspx "Subtext Release Announcement")
with only a few minor hitches which is a great feeling.

Also during the week, my wife received a huge raise from her boss. In
part this was a response to an impressive offer made by a large clothing
company she was on “loan” to as a [pattern
maker](/archive/2004/03/13/250.aspx "Architect Of The Fashion World").
The fashion district in Los Angeles is known for being quite stingy with
the employee pay, so this came as a bit of a surprise. Basically this
means we can upgrade from Ramen to some pricier noodles for our three
squares.

In truth, it means the risk we took in me taking a large paycut to start
a company with [Micah](http://micahdylan.com/ "Micah Dylan Blog") is
largely mitigated. We can start putting money back into our savings.

![Soccer Ball](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SoccerBallBW.jpg) On the soccer
front we finally had the opening game of the season for the competitive
league I joined. Up until now, we’ve been playing a few pre-season
practice games.

We opened up the season with a 2 to 0 win with a goal from yours truly.
In the other league, we won 4 to 1 in a game where I flubbed two good
chances. So I had exactly one day to relish and replay the goal in my
head before it was completely replaced with the two I should have put
in.

In any case, it was a much better soccer weekend than the [previous

PS: The term “Haackayamas” is a term our friends use for me and my wife.
It is a mashup of my last name and hers.
