UPDATE: I long ago stopped supporting Captain Hook. This is a dead
project.

![CaptainHook](https://haacked.com/assets/images/captainhook.gif) I recently
introduced an [internal tool for writing Subversion
Hooks](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/07/27/IntroducingCaptainHookASubversionHookFrameworkFor.NET.aspx "Introducing CaptainHook")
that we developed for internal use at
[VelocIT](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT"). We made the source code and
binaries available to the general public and there was enough interest
(hey, it only takes two or three and I’m sold!) that we decided to make
an Open Source project out of it [hosted on
SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/captainhook/ "SourceForge").
This is our company’s first Open Source project and we hope many will
find it useful.

I thought about using CodePlex to try it out, but in this particular
case I figured it would be less of a pain to host it in a Subversion
repository since this is a tool for Subversion users after all.

### At a Glance

**Mailing List**
:   captainhook-devs at lists dot sourceforge dot net
**Commits Mailing List**
:   captainhook-commits at lists dot sourceforge dot net
**Subversion Repository**
:   https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/captainhook/trunk
**License**
:   [BSD](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php "BSD License")

~~The mailing list might not be ready at the time you read this~~ If you
would like to have Subversion commit access, please join the mailing
list and send an email to the list with your SourceForge username.
Please only request access if you are planning to work on it in the next
few months. I will probably cap it after some point just to keep the
process sane (not that I am expecting a flood of requests, but you never
know).

And of course CaptainHook is [licensed as
BSD](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php "BSD License").
Any code contributions should have their copyright for the contribution
assigned to VelocIT, the maintainer of the project (an informal email
ackowledgement is sufficient). As I [mentioned
before](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/26/WhoOwnstheCopyrightforAnOpenSourceProject.aspx "Who Owns The Copyright"),
assigning copyright when contributing is a standard operating procedure
and nothing insidious. You do not lose your own rights to use the code
elsewhere since the code is licensed as BSD.

Enjoy!
