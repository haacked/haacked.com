Way back in the day I worked on a website called MyLaunch which later
changed its name to Launch before being bought by Yahoo where it [now
lives](http://music.yahoo.com/ "Launch").

One of the features it boasted was collaborative filtering using what
was then called Firefly technology. The problem was that users had to go
in and rate a bunch of songs and artists before you would get any
meaningful results.

It would have been nice if there were some way for the site to simply
listen in on what you were listening to and make recommendations based
on your actual habits. That’s what Last.FM does.

There are two components to Last.FM, a plug-in that sends information to
the Last.FM web services about the music you are listening to. This
[requires a
plug-in](http://www.last.fm/postsignup.php "Last.FM Plugins") to your
favorite audio program. I installed the iTunes plugin.

The second component is a player that delivers a customized radio
station with selections based on your tastes. I haven’t used this but
Jon Galloway [writes about a C#
player](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/02/19/438544.aspx "Last.FM Player")
that is a worthwhile replacement for the lame player offered by Last.FM.
Jon recently open sourced the codebase started by another developer,
[Eric Willis](http://www.fairlyrealistic.com/ "Eric Willis's Blog"),
with his permission.

Give it a twirl. You can see what amazing taste in music I have by
checking out my [Last.FM profile
