I am absolutely livid with my company’s bank right now and I need to
blow off some steam. We had two recent deposits reversed because of a
missing endorsement. This is odd because I am always careful to sign
every check. Well it turns out that they changed their endorsement
policy on March 31 and didn’t bother to notify us.

The problem is not that the new requirements are so onerous, they are
not, but that without notification, I have no way of knowing the new
requirements. Adding to the problem is that they mail the checks back (I
live walking distance from our local Washington Mutual) and it has been
a week already and we haven’t received our first check back. As any
small business owner knows, cash flow is king. When the checks arrive is
more important than the amounts of the checks.

I absolutely detest the horrendous level of service banks provide. When
I moved to Los Angeles, I started with Bank of America and they were the
absolute worst experience I have ever had. But WAMU is closing down on
that.

Well anyways, thanks for letting me blow some steam. I needed that.
