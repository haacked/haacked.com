[Lightbox
JS](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/ "The original Lightbox")
brought a new level of hotness when it came to displaying pictures on
your website or blog. Reference the javascript file in your html page,
add a `rel="lightbox"` to a link, and voila! You have a sweet way to
display pics. I even implemented it on my blog as evidenced by the image
below. Go ahead, click on it (assuming you are not reading this in an
aggregator).

Pretty cool eh? Well just as I go and get this implemented, the people
that brought you Lightbox JS just released [Lightbox JS
2.0](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/ "Lightbox the next generation").
New in 2.0 is an easy way to group related images and slickly navigate
through them. They also added some fancy schmancy transition effects.

The image above is a screenshot of the image grouping feature in action.
Notice the *Next* link that displays on the upper right when you mouse
over the image. Click on the below image to see a larger screenshot. (Oh
the irony using Lightbox 1.0 to demonstrate Lightbox 2.0).

This is just one of many cool new toys for the discerning blogger. Good
job [Lokesh](http://huddletogether.com/ "Lokesh's Blog")!
