[K. Scott
Allen](http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/ "Scott Allen's Blog"), famous
for his OdeToCode blog signed on to be the fourth co-author. His
expertise and writing ability will help to compensate for our lack of
such things.

A little while ago I wrote an email to the subtext-devs mailing list
mentioning that I will be cutting back my day-to-day involvement in
Subtext until
around spring/summer of the new year.  I will still be involved, of
course, but I cannot spend as much time writing code as I have been in
the past.

However, my [Subtext recruiting
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/03/Seriously_Cool_Jobs_Available.aspx "Cool Jobs Available")
was quite successful and many new developers have joined in to keep
Subtext humming along. Not only that, developers who have long been
involved with Subtext have also picked up the slack with major
contributions.  For that, I am appreciative to see things moving forward
toward the best release of Subtext yet sometime in the new year.

So what exactly is keeping me so busy? 

I will be writing a *Cook Book* style book on ASP.NET 2.0 with my
co-authors [Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/) and [Jeff
"CodingHorror" Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "Coding Horror").  The
three of us have long talked about writing a book together, and this
opportunity from [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/ "SitePoint") came
along at the right time.  We just signed the contract recently and
already I am panicking about the various deadlines.

It’s good to get the panic and self-doubts over with early (*everyone
will hate the book...no worse, they'll be indifferent to the book and
hate me, spitting on me at Mix 09 when I finally release the book years
late for rotting their brains just reading a synposis*) so I can get to
the business of writing a fantastic book.

I’ve contributed a couple of sections to a book before ([Windows
Developer Power
Tools](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Developer-Power-Tools-Turbocharge/dp/0596527543 "Windows Developer Power Tools")),
but that was nothing compared to co-authoring and writing a full third
of a book.  I will be looking to my capable co-authors to make me look
good.

So you may notice the frequency of blogging drop off for a bit, but I
plan to pick it up a bit as I write the book, focusing on little pieces
that relate to the book.  Wish us luck!
