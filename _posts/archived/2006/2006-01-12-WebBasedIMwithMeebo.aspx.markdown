Can’t use your favorite IM tool because of a pesky firewall at your
place of work? Kyle points me to this web app,
[Meebo](http://meebo.com/) which appears to be in the alpha phase, but
worked fine for me. It allows you to sign in to one of several popular
IM services and use a rich web-based client.

So if your worksite allows you to browse the web, you can also chat.

Here’s a screenshot of a section of the login page.

According to the site, passwords are encrypted with 1024-bit RSA keys.
Below is a screenshot of a Yahoo Messenger session. Notice the nice
transparent effects when highlighting a profile.
