![Subtext Logo](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SubtextLogo.png) No, this is
not a case of breaking and entering. With preparations for the next
release of Subtext, apparently our SourceForge ranking has climbed up
into the top 15. Now keep in mind this is a ranking of the most *active*
projects, and is not a ranking of the success or value of a project. It
is an amalgamation of source control checkins, discussion forum
activity, and other statistical factors.

Even so, it is satisfying to see our project [listed as
\#13](http://sourceforge.net/top/mostactive.php?type=week "Most Active Projects")
in the most active projects last week. It is an indication that more and
more people are getting involved and having fun building this puppy.

I hadn’t even noticed until
[several](http://blog.davestechshop.net/archive/2006/08/09/SubTextInTop25.aspx "Subtext in top 25")
[people](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2006/08/08/subTEXT_Breaks_Top_25_on_SourceForge.net.aspx "Top 25")
[pointed](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/piyo/archive/2006/08/10/46061.aspx "Subtext top 15")
it out.

I imagine that number will dip after we release when we all take a
collective sigh of relief.
