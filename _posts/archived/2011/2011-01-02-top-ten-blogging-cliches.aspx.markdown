Dear Reader, I apologize for not blogging much lately. I know, total
\#fail, but I’ve been so f\*\*\*ing busy lately. I thought I would start
off this new year right with a top ten list FTW!

Without further ado, I present my list of the top 10 blogging clichés of
2010. These are things yours truly would **never ever** do,
right?[![stones-on-a-beach](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/MyTop10BloggingClichesof2009_123D2/stones-on-a-beach_3.jpg "stones-on-a-beach")](http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1245904 "Shore and rocks near Front Street in Lahaina by Beneeb on sxc.hu")

1.  **The random photo:** Starting off the list is a very common one
    that even gets the very best bloggers, including a random photo in
    the blog post completely irrelevant to the topic at hand as if
    trying to meet a stock photography quota for the month. Perhaps you
    own stock in the [stock xchng](http://sxc.hu/ "Stock Exchange") (or
    perhaps I should!). At least *try* to make the photo slightly
    relevant so it adds something to the post.
2.  **“Dear Reader”:**Is there a more patronizingly boorish phrase to
    use to refer to those reading your blog than “Dear Reader”. Do you
    know if the person reading your blog is dear? Seriously, he or she
    could be a total prick who’s only redeeming quality is that he or
    she clicks on your AdSense link so you can buy a cup of coffee in
    two years. Do you realize that the person reading the blog might be
    me? I’m a total jerk and I don’t click on your ad links, but you
    just complimented me. Ha! When I read a blog post that uses the
    phrase “Dear Reader” what I see in my head is “Dear random person
    that I hope clicks on my ads”. I’ve used it [at least five
    times](https://haacked.com/search.aspx?q=Dear%20Reader "Dear Reader").
    Don’t be like me.
3.  **Apologizing for not posting regularly:** I have a dirty little
    secret, nobody gives a flying f\*\*\* whether or not you’re posting
    regularly (unless you’re [Randall
    Munroe](http://xkcd.com/ "XKCD.com"), then we absolutely do care),
    [so stop apologizing for
    it](http://melly.me/stop-apologizing-for-not-blogging "Stop Apologizing for not blogging").
    They’re all using some sort of RSS aggregator in the first place so
    they didn’t even have a clue to how lame you are up until the point
    that just reminded them. Great job Sport!
4.  **Using f\*\*\* when you really meant to say “fuck”:** It’s just a
    fucking word! If you really mean to use it for emphasis, just
    fucking use it! Nobody, in the history of humanity, ever lost his
    sight, hearing, or sanity from reading the word fuck. Not to mention
    that you’re not fooling anyone when you type f\*\*\*. Do you really
    have such a low opinion of your readers that you think they’re
    sitting there thinking “Gee, I wonder wonder what word that could
    be? Good thing he asterisked the fuck out of that word because I
    might go blind if he had spelled it out.”
5.  **Overusing the word “fuck”:** Whoa nelly! Just because it’s ok to
    unmask those asterisks from time to time doesn’t mean we should go
    overboard here. Slowly back away from the “F” key. The word is meant
    to be very lightly sprinkled to pack a powerful punch when you need
    it. It’s not meant to be poured liberally like salt in a futile
    attempt to salvage taste from your awful cooking.
6.  **“Wah wah, I’m so busy.”:**You know what, we’re all fucking busy,
    so shut your pie hole about it already.
7.  **“Hinting at a super secret project you can’t reveal just yet.”:**
    Yeah yeah, we get it. You know something we don’t know so you’re
    going to rub our faces in it like a bad little doggy who just did a
    no-no. Bad doggy! This may even be the reason you’re “so busy”. Well
    I have news for you…wait for it. Wait for it. Nobody cares! Maybe
    your project really is the next big thing since that little plastic
    triangle thingy that holds the pizza box up away from the cheese.
    Really, that thing is awesome! Maybe your project is better than
    that, but if you can’t talk about it yet, you’re just wasting
    bandwidth. Once again, shut your pie hole until you *can* talk about
    it.
8.  **Top ten lists, for all values of “ten”:**Top ten (or eight, or
    eleven, or any number) lists are a cop out. You know it, I know it,
    and your readers know it. Top ten lists are what happens when a
    blogger is in the middle of writing a blog post apologizing for not
    posting regularly and thinks, “What the f\*\*\* am I apologizing
    for?! I know, I’ll write a top ten list of the varieties of lint I
    found in my belly button.” Yeah, you’ll make the front page of
    Reddit, but at what cost of your soul, dear reader? What cost?
9.  **Name Dropping:**So just last year I was chatting with my friends
    [Jeff Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror") (aka
    CodingHorror), George Clooney, and [Miguel De
    Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel's Blog") (aka Mr. Mono)
    about how lame it is to name drop. There’s nothing lamer than that
    except for name dropping about fictitious events that never
    happened. Seriously, nobody is going to change their opinion of how
    lame you are just because you happened to have seen the neighbor of
    the third cousin of [Bruce
    Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/ "Bruce Schneier's Blog") from
    across the conference hall floor (but if you did, high five right
    atcha!).
10. **“FTW!”** Yes, we all know you’re so hard core and like to express
    your enthusiasm while simultaneously tweaking your nose at the
    powers that be, but seriously now. You’re all growed up and it’s
    time to lay this one to rest, in the same way you no longer play
    with your GI Joes except when the wife has the kids at her mother’s.
    One exception to this rule, it’s perfectly fine to use it on
    Twitter, but only because of its brevity and only until we come up
    with something better.

Yes, some of these clichés were also noted back in 2007 as [reported in
CodingHorror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000834.html "Blogging Cliches"),
but apparently nobody got the memo as they were still going strong in
2010. Now it is 2011 and I’ve made a new years resolution to avoid such
blogging clichés. How am I doing so far?

Probably about as well as my resolution to stop procrastinating, which I
made *after* the new year, so I’m not off to a good start on that one
either. ![Winking

*Before you flame me about this blog post, this was all in good fun. I
love top 10 lists for binary values of 10!*
