I hate code samples in technical books! No seriously, this is bile I’m
not afraid to [give a
permalink](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DontGiveBileAPermalinkFindingBalanceWithinTheNoAssholeRule.aspx "Don't give bile a permalink")
to (nor am I afraid to end a sentence with a preposition, so there!).

Even the shortest code samples are a pain to type in. And if they show
anything reasonably interesting, they’re probably too long to type in.

Of course, nobody actually types in the sample code, they grab the code
from the companion CD (blech!) or download zip files containing the code
from the companion website.

edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118076583/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1118076583 "Print Edition")
| [kindle
edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EHG1TI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B005EHG1TI))
we experimented with a different approach. We made our sample code
available as [NuGet](http://nuget.org/ "NuGet") packages.

It seemed fitting given that ASP.NET MVC 3 included NuGet 1.0 as part of
the product. The benefit of this approach is that there’s no fiddling
around with downloading and unpacking files and copying source files
into the right place.

Throughout the book, you’ll run into a call-out with a command that says
something like `Install-Package Wrox.SomethingOrOther`. If you’re
following along with an ASP.NET MVC 3 project open in Visual Studio,
it’s as easy as installing that package and you have the source code
nicely organized and immediately runnable!

Along with the easily installable code samples, the book covers all the
cool new features of ASP.NET MVC 3 including EF Code First Scaffolding,
NuGet, and Razor.

For those that like to dig deeper, the book covers the concept of
dependency injection and ASP.NET MVC 3’s support for it as well as Test
Driven Development (TDD) with ASP.NET MVC. These chapters were written
by [Brad Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson's Blog"),
who’s also a co-author of the [xUnit.net unit test
framework](http://xunit.codeplex.com/ "xUnit").

Along with Brad, I had the pleasure of also working with [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway") and [K.
Scott Allen](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/). This was a bit of a
reunion for K. Scott, Jon, and I as we [co-authored a
book](http://www.amazon.com/ASP-Net-2-0-Anthology-Essential-Tricks/dp/098028581X "ASP.NET 2 Anthology")
with [Jeff Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror") (aka
CodingHorror) a lifetime ago.

Since Brad and I are on the product team, we were able to sprinkle in
behind-the-scene tidbits from the product team that provide insight into
how or why certain decisions were made when it came to the product
design.

If you read the book (again, available in both a [print
edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118076583/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1118076583 "Print Edition")
and a [kindle
edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EHG1TI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B005EHG1TI).
Don’t be shy about collecting them all! ![Winking

please do write a review on Amazon.com. We appreciate all the feedback
we can get and already have ideas on how to improve the next one!

Also, a lot of folks have asked me why the Kindle is priced more than
the paperback in some areas. We’re not really in control of that. The
suggested retail price of the two editions are exactly the same, but
Amazon provides different discounts for each edition.

As to the question, why are the suggested retail prices the same? I
really don’t know but I plan to suggest that the electronic edition
ought to be cheaper.
