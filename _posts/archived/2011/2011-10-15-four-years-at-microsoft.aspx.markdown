Today, October 15 2011, marks four years of being a Microsoft employee
for me. As such, it’s time for a little introspection, but in many ways,
Tim Heuer already [introspected for
me](http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2011/08/24/working-at-microsoft-instrospection.aspx "Working at Microsoft").
Much of what he writes echoes my own experience, thus leaving me with
less to write about.

Looking back in my archives, I realized I haven’t written a whole lot
about what it’s like to work here. I do have a few posts such as…

-   My [announcement about being
    hired](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/17/why-is-microsoft-removing-my-mvp-status.aspx "Why Is Microsoft Removing My MVP Status?").
    I was really floored by the number of folks who commented (112) to
    wish  me well. Thank you!
-   Not long after, I blogged about [drinking from the
    firehose](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/10/26/drinking-from-the-firehose.aspx "Drinking from the firehose").
-   I blogged again [at the one year
    mark](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/10/15/one-year-at-microsoft.aspx "One Year at Microsoft").

Regarding the second post, the funny thing is you never stop drinking
from the fire hose here. At least I haven’t yet. And that’s both a good
thing, but it can be wearying at times. I’ve been taking a lot of
mini-vacations lately to keep my sanity.

So far, the past four years have been a real blast.

I’ve had a passion for open source for a very long time. When I started,
ASP.NET MVC 1.0 was just getting going as a proprietary project. Very
few teams at that time released their source code, much less under a
proper OSS license. Although it involved sitting in a lot of meetings
with lawyers, reviewing lots of dry legal documents, I loved the
opportunity to help drive the process to get ASP.NET MVC licensed under
the [Ms-PL](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MS-PL "Ms-PL"), a liberal
OSI certified open source license. Announcing that release [was a happy
day for
me](https://haacked.com/archive/2009/04/01/aspnetmvc-open-source.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 1.0 under the Ms-PL").

Since that time, we’ve shipped four RTM releases of ASP.NET MVC (recall
that we released ASP.NET MVC 3 twice), each incorporating more and more
third-party open source software, another milestone. As they say,
[shipping is a
feature](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/12/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway.html "Version 1 sucks, but ship it anyways")!
And the ASP.NET team, and the MVC team in particular, are all really
great people to work with. Hat tip to them all!

In this time, I’ve also had the great pleasure to work on NuGet from its
inception. NuGet goes one step further in that it’s not only an open
source project under the Apache v2 license, but it accepts
contributions. Microsoft contributed NuGet to the [Outercurve
Foundation](http://www.outercurve.org/ "Outercurve Foundation") (an
independent open source foundation not unlike the Apache and Eclipse
foundation that recently received its non-profit status!) early in its
life allowing it to flourish as an open source project.

Microsoft has a team of employees who are allowed to spend work-time
contributing to the NuGet project. All development, issue tracking, and
discussion occurs in a public location, the NuGet
[CodePlex](http://nuget.codeplex.com/ "NuGet on CodePlex") site, with
Mercurial (hg) as the source code repository.

The NuGet team is a dedicated group of folks and it’s really a joy to
work with them. The community involvement and feedback has been
tremendous. I used to tell folks that I wanted to work on open source as
my day job. That wish came true. It’s a real joy.

The past four years have also had their fair share of challenges behind
the scenes. When you work with the intensely smart folks that I have the
pleasure to work with, it’s hard not to feel the effects of the
[Impostor
Syndrome](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx "Impostor Syndrome"),
as Hanselman writes.  And with everything I work on, I have a keen eye
for all the shortcomings and faults in what we produce. I find it hard
to tout our releases as much as I could because I always wish we could
have done better. Perhaps because I’m a perfectionist, but more likely
due to my half-Asian upbringing. I’m forced to find fault in everything.

Despite all that, I do take pride in the great work that the teams I
work with have done. Their efforts have been tremendous and they deserve
all the credit. I only hope my contributions were indeed contributions
and not just overhead.

And I want to thank many of you, who’ve offered us encouragement and
constructive criticism via Twitter, your blogs, my blog, our forums,
StackOverflow, and so on. All of it is very much appreciated! Without
your help, I don’t think I would have done as well in the past year.
Don’t be surprised when I come knocking on your door asking for more
help. Did I mention already that NuGet accepts contributions?
