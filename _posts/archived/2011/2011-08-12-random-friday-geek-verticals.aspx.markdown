Stumbling around the net, I ran into the “funny verticals” meme. These
are typically a vertical strip of screenshots pulled from a movie or
television with funny captions tacked on.

If you do an image search for “[funny
verticals](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=funny+verticals&hl=en&biw=1440&bih=805&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&ei=iVpFTsyWE8TZiALlo4nXAQ&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&cd=2&ved=0CAsQ_AUoAQ "Funny verticals")”,
you’ll see a whole slew of them. Be forewarned, there are some very
crude and offensive ones.

For the lazy, here are a few representative ones I found to be funny.
The first example is from the movie Inception:

This is another one from Inception. There seems to be a lot using this
specific sequence.

And here’s one from the television show, LOST.

On a lark, I thought it’d be funny to *try* and do a geek version of
this meme. I chose two personalities in our community I figured would be
very well known, [Scott
Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/ "Scott Hanselman's Blog") and [Scott
Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu "Scott Guthrie's blog"). This
has absolutely nothing to do with Hanselman posting [this photo on his
blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast261ASPNETMVC3ToolsUpdateWithPhilHaack.aspx "Phil's Fashion")
because I’m not the vengeful type. Nosiree.

I’ll post my versions here as well as the raw image because I know
you’ll do much better than me. I needed to keep it tame because I do
enjoy my employer’s salary continuation plan.

Here’s another one using the same template.

I tried changing this last one up a bit.

It’s pretty challenging to do this with folks who are not
television/movie celebrities because you have far fewer images to work
from, so I did the best I could with what I could find.
