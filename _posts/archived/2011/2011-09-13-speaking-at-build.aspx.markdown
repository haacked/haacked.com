you’re at the BUILD conference in Anaheim, I’ll be speaking in two
sessions on Thursday.

> **[Progressively enable the mobile web with ASP.NET MVC 4, HTML5, and
> jQuery
> Mobile](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-803T)
> Thursday, 9:00 AM**
>
> There are over a billion mobile devices with rich Web capabilities,
> yet many Websites look terrible on such devices, or worse, fail to
> work at all. As mobile devices become the primary way that most people
> access the Web, having a site that fails to deliver a rich experience
> on the Web using HTML5, JavaScript and jQuery Mobile is missing out on
> a huge opportunity. In this session, learn how ASP.NET MVC 4 leverages
> these next generation technologies enabling developers to build a
> single solution that targets multiple platforms and form factors such
> as mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

**UPDATE: Unfortunately, we had to cancel the second talk due to a
family illness which required that Damian go home early. Damian and I
plan to record the session later and post it on Channel 9.**The second
talk is a joint talk with [Damian
Edwards](http://damianedwards.wordpress.com/ "Damian Edwards"). 

> [**Building IIS and ASP.NET apps with the power of
> async**](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/SAC-804T "Async and ASP.NET abstract")**Thursday,
> 2:30 PM**
>
> It’s well established from both theory and practice that Web sites and
> Web services achieve scale through asynchrony. If a dedicated thread
> is required per client connection to a server, scalability becomes
> limited by the number of threads the server system can support, which
> is typically far fewer than business requirements demand.
> Unfortunately, it’s also been difficult historically for developers to
> write asynchronous apps, due to the myriad of callbacks that have been
> necessary to program asynchrony successfully. Thus, businesses scale
> by investing in many more machines rather than by making better use of
> the ones they already have or the few they’re paying for use of in the
> cloud. All that changes with the next release of Visual Studio and
> .NET. New features in managed languages make writing asynchronous code
> as simple as writing synchronous code, thereby enabling both developer
> productivity and good return on investments. In this code-heavy
> session, learn how you can be the hero of your organization, building
> efficient and scalable server apps that best utilize your company’s
> resources.

If you’re here, I hope you can make it. I’ll be giving out NuGet
stickers at my sessions.
