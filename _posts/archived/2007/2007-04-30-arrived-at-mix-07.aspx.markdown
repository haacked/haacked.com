Well [Jon](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway's Blog") and
I arrived safely, driving into Vegas around 4 PM last evening. Upon
arriving, we met up with [Miguel De
Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel's Blog"), the founder of the
Mono project, and headed over to the Mashup Lounge where we ran into
[John Osborne](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/468 "John Osborne"), a
senior editor with O' Reilly.

Being the small world that it is, John was a reviewer for the [Windows
Developer Power
Tools](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Developer-Power-Tools-Turbocharge/dp/0596527543/ "Developer Power Tools on Amazon")
book and happened to review the section I wrote on Tortoise CVS/SVN.

We were joined by [Eric
Kemp](http://monk.thelonio.us/Default.aspx "Eric's Blog"), one of the
members of the Subsonic team and fun conversation on Open Source, Mono,
Politics, etc... ensued.

Later on in the evening we headed over the BlogZone, a suite in the
Venetian towers with a couple of X-Boxes, food, and drinks. We were
later joined by Jeff Atwood, Scott Hanselman, Clemens Vasters, Steve
Maine and a deadly game of Guitar Hero ensued.

Keynote is about to start, will write more later.
