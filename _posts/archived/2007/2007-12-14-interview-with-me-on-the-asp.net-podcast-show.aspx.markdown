Yesterday, [Wally
McClure](http://morewally.com/cs/Default.aspx "MoreWally") interviewed
me for the ASP.NET Podcast Show. We chatted for around half an hour on
my background, Microsoft, and ASP.NET MVC.

It was a fun chat, but I have to warn you, I was very sleep deprived (*a
constant condition lately*), so at points I tend to ramble a bit,
second-guess myself (*I was right the first time,
model-view-thing-editor!*), and even contradict myself.

I’m not normally that harebrained. I promise. Ok, maybe just a little.
With all those caveats in place, [give it a
listen](http://morewally.com/cs/blogs/wallym/archive/2007/12/14/asp-net-podcast-show-106-phil-haack-on-asp-net-mvc.aspx "Phil Haack on ASP.NET MVC").

This is why writing a blog is so much easier than being interviewed. All
the times I correct myself are not visible in a blog entry.
