Microsoft just unveiled [a new web
property](http://www.microsoft.com/opensource/) intended to clarify its
position on Open Source as well as provide a one-stop location to find
out what Microsoft is doing in the Open Source space.

Despite all the (perhaps well deserved) criticism of how Microsoft has
not supported Open Source in the past, I think the behemoth is slowly
starting to get it. Or at least *groups within Microsoft* are starting
to see that if they don't embrace Open Source, Microsoft will get left
behind, much like they did for a while with the web revolution.
Embracing Open Source makes good long term business sense for Microsoft.

**As a big company, Microsoft moves slowly, but there are concrete signs
of progress**.

-   [Port25](http://port25.technet.com/ "Microsoft's Open Source Lab"),
    the Open Source Software Lab (ugly site, but chock full of info)
-   [Sam Ramji](http://samus.typepad.com/ "Sam Ramji"), whose official
    title is Director of Platform Technology Strategy but is for all
    intents and purposes, the Director of Open Source at Microsoft and
    heads the Open Source Lab there.
-   [Garret

    holds the title *Open Source Community Lead* at Microsoft.

Sure, there is much more to do and I'm sure many will remain skeptical
and wary of Microsoft's slow movement into this area. However, I see the
signs of progress and believe there will be bigger things to come.
