A recent confrontational [thread within the Subtext
forums](http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4227149 "Subtext Forum Thread")
that I shared with [Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery")
got us into a discussion about the challenges of dealing with difficult
members of an Open Source community. There are many approaches one can
take. Some advocate not engaging disruptive community members. I tend to
give everyone the benefit of the doubt at first. Rob often commends me
for my paticence in dealing with users in the forums. Neither approach
is necessarily better than the other. It’s a matter of style.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned about running an Open Source project,
it’s that it takes two key qualities.

**First, you really need to have a thick skin.** You cannot please
everybody, and if you’re doing something even remotely interesting,
you’re going to piss off some people with the choices you make. But you
can’t stop making choices, so be prepared to piss people off. It’s a
part of the job. Just be mentally prepared for the attacks, fair or not.

Second, you have to have empathy for your users and developers.**
Sometimes what feels like an attack is really a misunderstanding based
on cultural differences. I know some cultures tend to have a very
brusque in-your-face way of discussion. What might be considered rude in
one culture, is considered a normal even keeled discussion in another.

At other times there may be an underlying reason for the venting which
really has nothing to do with you or your project.

Sure, it’s not really fair to take the brunt of someone’s wrath because
of what happens elsewhere, but I find that humor and attempting to focus
the discussion to specific objective complaints often helps defuse an
argumentative thread.

In this particular case, the user ends up apologizing and writes about
the aggravating events at work that led to his frustrations and lashing
out in our forums.

Apology accepted, no hard feelings.

**What about Toxic members?** Sometimes there are members of the
community who really are simply toxic trolls. They’re not interested in
having any sort of real discussion. How do you deal with them? How do
you tell them apart from someone who actually does care about your
project, but is so ineloquent about expressing that?

I’ve been fortunate not to have experienced this with Subtext yet, but
this excellent post [How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous
People](http://innovation-in-oil-and-gas.blogspot.com/2007/02/how-open-source-projects-survive.html "How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People")
points out some great advice for identifying and dealing with poisonous
people.

The post is a summary [a
video](http://innovation-in-oil-and-gas.blogspot.com/2007/02/how-open-source-projects-survive.html "Survive Poisonous People")
in which Ben Collins-Sussman and Brian Fitzpatrick, members of the
Subversion team, discuss how to deal with poisonous people based on
their experiences with Subversion.

Their points are specific to *their* experience running an Open Source
project. But many of their points apply to any sort of community, not
just Open Source.

Politeness, Respect, Trust, and Humility go along way to building a
strong community. To that list I would also add Empathy.
