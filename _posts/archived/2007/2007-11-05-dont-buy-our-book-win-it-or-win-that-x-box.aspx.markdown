Recently I [gave out a few free
copies](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/10/04/get-a-free-copy-of-our-new-book.aspx "Get a Free Copy of our new book")
of a book I co-wrote, but ran out quickly. This is the same book that
[Jeff Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "Jeff Atwood") (a co-author) told
everyone, [*Do Not Buy This
Book*](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000971.html "Do Not Buy This Book").

Well, if you didn’t get a copy, there is another opportunity to get a
free copy. [DotNetSlackers](http://dotnetslackers.com/ "DotNetSlackers")
is running a contest and will reward the top 3 contributors to their
forums (ooh, that could get...interesting. *First Post!*or*I
Agree!*Count it up.) with great prizes.

![ASP.NET 2.0
Anthology](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/DontBuyOurBookWinItOrWinthatXBoxYourChoi_8699/aspnetAnthology_5.gif)
Unfortunately, our book is part of a second prize package which includes
ANTS Profiler Pro. Our book is also the third-prize.

Why is that unfortunate?

![XBox 360
Elite](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/DontBuyOurBookWinItOrWinthatXBoxYourChoi_8699/xboxelite_3.jpg)
Because if you want a free copy of our book, you have to try real hard
not to do too well that you win first prize, which is an XBox 360 Elite
along with Telerik RadControls. Once you got your hands on Halo 3 or
Gears of War, you’d have no time to read our book! And you wouldn’t want
that, would you?

In any case, for more contest details, check out [the contest
page](http://dotnetslackers.com/contest/peers/ "Contribute to DotNetSlackers community and win prizes").
