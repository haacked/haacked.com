According to FeedBurner, many of my readers are from London, so I
thought you might enjoy this little tale.

Tonight, I met someone extremely famous, or so I was told. When I got
home, I looked him up, and sure enough, he is **huge** in Europe.
According to Wikipedia, “he has sold more albums in the UK than any
other British solo artist in history”.

Have any of you heard of [Robbie
Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams "Robbie Williams")?

My wife knew who he was immediately. Must be the fact that she’s a
British citizen (she has dual Japanese citizenship as well). She played
one of his songs from an Alice 97.3 compilation we have. I rather liked
it.

It turns out that he runs (owns?) a soccer team in Los Angeles. We had a
friendly scrimmage set up with them at UCLA. I fully expected we’d be
playing on the intramural fields where everyone else plays, but instead
we played on the immaculate UCLA Football team’s practice field.

This seems to be a trend I’m noticing among British music stars. They
move to Los Angeles and start up soccer teams to manage. They also seem
to have the means to absorb some of the best talent in Los Angeles in
doing so.

As I’ve written before, [Steve
Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jones_(musician) "Steve Jones")
of the Sex Pistols runs a [team in my
league](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/12/16/Played_Soccer_Against_The_Juggernaut.aspx "Playing against the juggernaut").
I have heard that [Rod
Stewart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart "Rod Stewart") has a
team in Los Angeles as well. I suppose if the day comes when I can’t run
on the pitch, and if I had that sort of money, I could see running a
soccer club (sorry, Footbal Club) as a fantastic hobby.

Not to be outdone, my team now has its own celebrity member. Santiago
Cabrera from the TV show Heroes is now a member of our team.

Fortunately, he is a very talented soccer player, scoring a bycicle kick
against us in our scrimmage tonight (he plays on the other team as
well). Now if we could just get some former pros to join us to help
solidify our midfield. Zidane, I’m looking at you buddy!
