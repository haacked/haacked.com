[Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "Coding Horror") writes
a great post on how to become a [better programmer by not
programming](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000543.html "Better Programming By Not Programming").
For the most part, I totally agree with his premise that to become a
better programmer, you need to...

> Learn about your users. Learn about the industry. Learn about your
> business.

Understanding the big picture is absolutely essential to being a good
developer. Especially when you’re in the 99^th^ percentile. The effort
to get to 99.5^th^ is very great and provides diminishing margins of
return.

However, most developers are not in the 99^th^ or even 90^th^ percentile
(by definition), and thus still have room for improvement in programming
ability, along with the important skills just mentioned.

**I am not convinced by the idea that developers are either born with it
or they are not. Where’s the empirical evidence to suport these types of
claims?** Can a programmer move from say the 50th to 90th percentile?

Jeff points out that study after study shows there is [no relationship
between a programmer’s amount of experience and code quality or
productivity](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000072.html "Skill Disparities in Programming").
I don’t doubt that for a second. I’ve worked with developers who have
10, 15, 20 years in the industry and couldn’t code a virtual rat through
a maze consisting of two parallel lines.

But recent research points out that the belief in innate talent is
“lacking in hard evidence to substantiate it” as well. I wrote about
this topic recently in my post, [The Question Of Innate
Talent](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/12/05/The_Question_Of_Innate_Talent.aspx "Question of Innate Talent").

**So how do I reconcile these seemingly contradictory statements?**

Well going back to the Scientific America article, [The Expert
Mind](http://scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleID=00010347-101C-14C1-8F9E83414B7F4945 "The Expert Mind"),
we get a clue.

So what we learn from this research is that **experience does not matter
to a person’s performance**. Exactly what the studies cited by Atwood
support. **However, what does have an impact is effortful study**.

[![Effortful
study](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/BetterProgrammingByProgrammingBetter_AD7E/Effortfulstudying_thumb2.jpg)](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/BetterProgrammingByProgrammingBetter_AD7E/Effortfulstudying4.jpg)

This makes a ton of sense to me. Typically, *experience* in any field,
especially software development, often means solving similar problems
over and over again using the same techniques as before. There is no way
this contributes to being a better programmer.

Sure an experienced developer had to learn new technologies to stay
relevant, but if the experienced developer applies the new
technologies in the same way over and over again, the developer has not
improved.

I’m currently looking at some legacy C# code written in a procedural
style. The developer can write C# code, but hasn’t taken the time to
learn to recognize when object oriented patterns would help solve a
problem more elegantly. Thus his experience has not made him a better
programmer.

However, with focused effortful study and training, a programmer can
lift him or herself out of mediocrity. **It’s not by programming
more one gets better, but by programming better**. Even better is to
program *more better* (as in more often and better).

Keep in mind though, that this takes nothing away from Atwood’s main
point. My point is that most developers (by definition) are not in the
90th percentile, at which point there is diminishing margins of return
for effortful study. Most developers still have room for improvement in
their coding skills as well as the ever important tangential skills to
which Atwood refers.

In fact, I believe that for many developers, the tangential skills will
distinguish and increase the value of a developer faster than improving
programming skills. But don’t toss out that book on Design Patterns just
yet.
