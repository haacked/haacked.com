Tuesday night I met [Rob
Conery](http://www.wekeroad.com/blogs/ "Rob Conery Ramblings"), aka Mr.
[Subsonic](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=actionpack "Subsonic - The Zero Code DAL"),
aka Mr. [Commerce Starter
Kit](http://www.commercestarterkit.org/ "Commerce Starter Kit"). The man
is shifty and goes by many aliases. He was in town visiting family and
was able to pull away for a night to kick it.

From time to time, I’ve met people in person at various conferences who
I only knew via their blogs. Usually, because you have no idea what to
expect, those meetings can be full of surprises.

> You’re nothing like how I pictured you in my head. I thought you’d be

Since I’ve chatted with Rob on Skype before, there were no surprises. 
Except that he’s ginormously tall. I literally almost blurted out,
*You’re a freakin' giant!* But was able to hold my tongue.

[Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway’s Blog")
joined us after a harrowing drive up the rain soaked freeway from San
Diego and we headed for [Hurry Curry of
Tokyo](http://www.hurrycurryoftokyo.com/ "Hurry Curry") on Sawtelle for
some delicious Japanese style Curry. After a couple of bottles of sake
and Sapporo beer, we headed over to [The Mór
Bar](http://www.themorbar.com/ "The Mor Bar") for \$2 Tuesdays with
Moontribe.

The Mór Bar is a sweet spot to hang out, get a drink, talk and listen to
good music. They have a nice arrangment of plush couch/benches in a
U-shape arrangement at the front of the bar on a deck, which evokes a
Lawrence of Arabia feel.

We settled in to geek out and Rob’s a fun guy to have a conversation
with. Just brimming with great ideas and interesting stories. Shortly
into it, Rob remarks on my total ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). What
the heck do you expect when you buy me a [Maker’s
Mark](http://www.makersmark.com/AgeCheck.aspx?redir=%2fDefault.aspx "Maker’s Mark")
for the first round of drinks? Yeah, I get easily distracted after
multiple shots of sake, beer, chased by a strong whiskey. What can I
say?

So there you have it, Rob’s Tall, Jon’s Bald, and I have ADD. Any case,
Rob, if you read this, I hope you got your Credit Card back. Good times.
Good times.
