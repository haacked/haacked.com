Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery") just announced that
[Beta 1 of SubSonic
2.0](http://blog.wekeroad.com/archive/2007/04/09/SubSonic-2.0-Beta-1-is-Ready.aspx "Subsonic 2.0 Beta 1")
is ready for your immediate data access needs. He’s looking for beta
testers (open to anyone and everyone) to make sure this release is rock
solid.

I may attempt to claim a significant contribution, but do not believe
me. I only contributed a teeny-tiny amount of code to this release.

I am using a small bit of
[Subsonic](http://www.codeplex.com/actionpack "Subsonic on CodePlex") in
a current project (just using it to generate Stored Procedure wrappers
since the existing database already has a legacy data model and stored
procedures to work with).

While I’m talking about release dates for open source projects, I should
mention that Subtext 1.9.5 will be released soon and afterwards we’ll
turn our full focus to getting Subtext 2.0 out the door. I’ve made some
progress on 2.0 while working on the 1.9 branch, so hopefully it will
follow 1.9 shortly.

My cohorts and I finished our first draft of the book [we’re working
on](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/19/writing_a_book.aspx "Writing a Book"),
so I should hopefully have more time to work on Subtext. That is, till
the [kid
arrives](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/05/World_Domination_Phase_1_Commenced.aspx "World Domination Phase 1").
