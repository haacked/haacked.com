You’ve been forewarned, this is yet another end-of-year slightly
self-inflating retrospective blog post (complete with the cheesy
meta-blogging introduction).

But this year for me was quite significant and full of big changes. On a
personal level, this was the year the agent of my little world
domination plan [was
hatched](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/06/06/introducing-cody-yokoyama-haack.aspx "Introducing Cody Yokoyama Haack").

He was tiny then, but six months later, he’s gotten quite big. He’s
remained in the 95^th^ percentile in height for a baby his age.

As much fun as it has been with Cody, he’s never taken his devious eye
off the prize in keeping with the master plan.

He is not going to be a kid one wants to mess with. I kid you not, he
laughs out loud with glee when I whack him with a pillow or pound on his
belly with my fists. That’s his idea of fun. As I said originally, he’s
a li’l thug.

In terms of my professional life, it’s been quite a whirlwind year. All
in the same year, I:

-   [left a consulting
    company](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/11/my-last-day-before-starting-a-new-career.aspx "New Career")
    I co-founded to join
    [Koders](http://koders.com/ "Open Source Search").
-   [cowrote](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/19/buy-our-book-and-become-an-asp.net-bad-ass.aspx "Buy our book")
    a book.
-   left Koders to [join
    Microsoft](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/17/why-is-microsoft-removing-my-mvp-status.aspx "Why is Microsoft removing my MVP Status").
-   Beat Scott Hanselman in a [Developer
    Faceoff](http://www.codesqueeze.com/developer-faceoff-scott-hanselman-vs-phil-haack "Developer Faceoff")
    ;)

Throughout this whole ordeal, my wonderful wife has been most gracious
and supportive. Consider the fact that when she was pregnant with Cody,
I was working as a co-owner at a startup, often not taking a paycheck so
we could pay our employees. That *has* to be stressful.

Then after one job change, I tell her about this great opportunity and
ask her if it is ok to move to Redmond. Her response was immediate.
*Let’s go!*What a woman!

Unfortunately once we made that decision, in a wonderful display of
synchronicity, the Los Angeles housing market stated a downward spiral.
We had zero offers for the first two months of trying to sell our house.
It was so bad, in fact, that we decided we would try and rent the house.
On the day we had an open house for renters, an offer came just in the
nick of time!

So while we close out another year, we’re also closing out the Los
Angeles era for my family. We really love this town. For one thing, we
have some great friends who live here. We’re trying to recruit them up
to Seattle, but they keep mumbling something about the rain and cold as
if it were a bad thing.

Something else we’ll miss is the great diverse food here. Many regard
the [Korean food in
L.A.](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/17/Good_Korean_Food_In_Los_Angeles.aspx "Good Korean Food")
as the best in the world. And the Japanese market and restaurants on
Sawtelle have been a staple for us.

I’ll particularly miss my [pickup soccer
crew](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/16/ForTheLoveOfSoccer.aspx "For the love of soccer")
as well as the [league of
ex-pros](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/23/Soccer_Beat_Down.aspx "Soccer Beatdown").
Lots to love about L.A., but at the same time, we’re quite excited about
our new adventures and opportunities up in the Seattle area. For
example, the opportunity to breathe clean air!

To all who have read this far, I hope 2007 was a good year for you and
that 2008 proves to be even better. Happy New Year!
