A common pattern when submitting a form in ASP.NET MVC is to post the
form data to an action which performs some operation and then redirects
to another action afterwards. The only problem is, the form data is not
repopulated automatically after a redirect. Let's look at remedying
that, shall we?

When submitting form data, the [ASP.NET MVC
Toolkit](http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/MVCToolkit.zip "MVC Toolkit")
includes a helper extension method that makes it easy to go the other
direction, populating an object from the request. Check out the
following simplified controller action adapted from an example ScottGu’s
[post on handling form
data](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-4-handling-form-edit-and-post-scenarios.aspx "Handling Form Data").

```csharp
[ControllerAction]
public void Create()
{
  Article article = new Article();
  article.UpdateFrom(Request.Form);
  
  repository.Persist(article);
 
  RedirectToAction("List");
}
```

`UpdateFrom()` is an extension method on the type `object` that will
attempt to populate each property of the object with a corresponding
value from the posted form.

The example above doesn’t address what should happen if the data passed
to product is incomplete or incorrect.

In that situation, I may want to redirect back to the action that
renders the form for creating a new product. But now I’m responsible for
populating the form fields because the posted values are lost after a
redirect.

One option is to use the `TempData` dictionary, which is intended for
these scenarios in which you need to persist data for the next request,
but not afterwards.

```csharp
[ControllerAction]
public void Create()
{
  Article article = new Article();
  article.UpdateFrom(Request.Form);
  
  //Pretend this was extensive validation
  if(article.IsValid)
  {
    repository.Persist(article);
    RedirectToAction("List");
  }
  else
  {
    TempData["message"] = "Please fill in all fields!";
    TempData["title"] = article.Title;
    TempData["body"] = article.Body;
    //... and so on and so on...

    //Takes us to a form for creating a product.
     RedirectToAction("New");
  }
}
```

That’ll work nicely for object with a small number of properties, but
when you have a lot of properties to store in `TempData`, it gets a bit
cumbersome. We have an extension method for populating an object from a
form, why not do something similar for populating `TempData` from an
object?

I put together a series of helper extension methods that help simplify
the above case. Using these extension methods, you can reduce the above
code to...

```csharp
[ControllerAction]
public void Create()
{
  Article article = new Article();
  article.UpdateFrom(Request.Form);
  
  //Pretend this was extensive validation
  if(article.IsValid)
  {
    repository.Persist(article);
    RedirectToAction("List");
  }
  else
  {
    TempData["Message"] = "Please supply all fields.";
    TempData.PopulateFrom(article);

    //Takes us to a form for creating a product.
     RedirectToAction("New");
  }
}
```

`PopulateFrom` is an extension method on `TempDataDictionary` that
populates the dictionary collection using whatever you pass into it. I
wrote some overloads so you can populate it directly from an object, the
form collection, or from a dictionary. I will show the code for the
extension methods at the end.

This gets us part of the way, but we still need to populate the form
field values in the view. Here is the relevant code snippet from the
*New* view.

```aspx-cs
<% using(Html.Form("Article", "Create")) { %>
    
<span class="error">
    <%= ViewContext.TempData.SafeGet("Message") %>
</span>

<label for="title">Title: </label> 
<%= Html.TextBox("title"
  , Html.Encode(ViewContext.TempData.SafeGet("title"))) %>

<label for="body">Body: </label>
<%= Html.TextArea("body"
  , Html.Encode(ViewContext.TempData.SafeGet("body"))) %>


<%= Html.SubmitButton() %>
<% } %>
```

When retrieving a value from the `TempData` dictionary, if the key you
specify doesn't exist, it throws an exception. So I added a `SafeGet`
extension method to make it cleaner to extract values from `TempData`.

*Note: We plan on making `TempData` a direct property of `ViewPage` in
the future, so you don't have to go through `ViewContext`.*

Here is the code for my temp data extensions...

```csharp
public static class TempDataExtensions
{
  public static void PopulateFrom(this TempDataDictionary tempData, object o)
  {
    foreach (PropertyValue property in o.GetProperties())
    {
      tempData[property.Name] = property.Value;
    }
  }

  public static void PopulateFrom(this TempDataDictionary tempData
    , NameValueCollection nameValueCollection)
  {
    foreach (string key in nameValueCollection.Keys)
      tempData[key] = nameValueCollection[key];
  }

  public static void PopulateFrom(this TempDataDictionary tempData
    , IDictionary<string, object> dictionary)
  {
    foreach (string key in dictionary.Keys)
      tempData[key] = dictionary[key];
  }

  public static string SafeGet(this TempDataDictionary tempData, string key)
  { 
    object value;
    if (!tempData.TryGetValue(key, out value))
      return string.Empty;
    return value.ToString();
  }
}
```

These methods rely on some object extension methods I wrote based on the
work that [Eilon
Lipton](http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/ "Eilon Lipton Lead Dev for ASP.NET MVC")
did with using [C\# 3.0 Anonymous Types as
Dictionaries](http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/archive/2007/09/24/using-c-3-0-anonymous-types-as-dictionaries.aspx "Anonymous Types To Dictionaries").

```csharp
public static class ObjectHelpers
{
  public static IDictionary<string, object> ToDictionary(this object o)
  {
    Dictionary<string, object> properties = new Dictionary<string, object>();

    foreach (PropertyValue property in o.GetProperties())
    {
      properties.Add(property.Name, property.Value);
    }
    return properties;
  }


  internal static IEnumerable<PropertyValue> GetProperties(this object o)
  {
    if (o != null)
    {
      PropertyDescriptorCollection props = TypeDescriptor.GetProperties(o);
      foreach (PropertyDescriptor prop in props)
      {
        object val = prop.GetValue(o);
        if (val != null)
        {
          yield return new PropertyValue { Name = prop.Name, Value = val };
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

internal sealed class PropertyValue
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public object Value { get; set; }
}
```

The `ToDictionary` method makes it easy to convert an anonymous typed
object to a dictionary.

Using these extension methods should help reduce some of the chore of
handling form submissions with the CTP version ASP.NET MVC. In future
versions of the framework, I hope we can make some of these common
scenarios more streamlined.

And before I forget, I have a **[simple solution for
download](https://haacked.com/code/TempDataDemo.zip "TempData Demo Solution")**
that includes full source code for the extension methods I wrote as well
as a trivially simple application that demonstrates using this code.
