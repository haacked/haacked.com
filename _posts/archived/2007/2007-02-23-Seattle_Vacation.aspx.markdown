I finally got around to uploading pics of our short [Seattle
vacation](http://www.flickr.com/photos/haacked/sets/72157594553243072/ "Seattle Vacation Pictures")
to Flickr. Our first full day there, Saturday, benefitted from beautiful
weather. We took a nice boat ride on Lake Washington and skipped by
BillG᾿s immense house.

The pic does not do it justice. There are a [few more
here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/haacked/tags/billgateshouse/ "Bill Gate᾿s House").
We must᾿ve gotten too close for comfort because a security guard came to
the water᾿s edge and [mad
dogged](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mad+dog "Urban Dictionary: Mad Dog")
us.

We also had the opportunity to check out the new sculpture park. I
thought it was quite interesting. One of my favorite sculptures was this
chrome tree, seen here behind a real tree.

I also had the opportunity to visit some friends at Microsoft.
Apparently Microsoft is experiencing explosive growth. My friend Julie
who worked on campus a couple years ago is now at an office complex one
freeway exit away off campus.

Our friends worked hard to convince us that we should move to Seattle.
But I think it may take more convincing, as we᾿ve both contracted a cold
and blame the damn Seattle weather.
