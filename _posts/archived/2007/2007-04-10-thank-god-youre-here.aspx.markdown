How good are you at thinking on your feet?

Last night I watched the premier for a new show called *Thank God You’re
Here*. It’s a sketch improv comedy show starring various comedy
television and movie stars, who have to bluff their way through a scene.
They are given costumes, a set, but no script.

The title of the show derives from the fact that the first line of
each skit is "Thank god you’re here!"

I love improv comedy and I thought Neuman from Seinfeld was great as
well as the dad from *Malcom in the Middle*. You can watch the [premier
online](http://www.nbc.com/Video/rewind/full_episodes/index.shtml?show=thankgod "Thank God You’re Here Premier").

It’s reminiscent of one of my favorite improv shows ever, Drew Carey’s
*Who’s Line Is It Anyways*?, but with better sets and costumes. Though
it remains to be seen if they will ever top the [funniest Whose Line
episode
ever](http://youtube.com/watch?v=CTxkxG3DF4k&mode=related&search= "The Funniest Whose Line") with
Richard Simmons.
