UPDATE: How could I have overlooked the [Plugin Keyvan
Nayyeri](http://nayyeri.net/archive/2006/12/07/xfn-link-plugin-for-windows-live-writer.aspx "XFN WLW plugin")
wrote two months ago. Sorry buddy!

You know what would go well with my [XFN Highlighter
Script](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/04/05/MakingMicroformatsMoreVisibleAnnouncingTheXFNHighlighterScript.aspx "XFN Highlighter Script")
like Kimchi goes with Bulkogi? How about a plugin for inserting proper
XFN hyperlinks?

[Scott Dornan](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/ "Scott Dornan") (and
Keyvan) delivers [exactly
that](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/02/08/105859.aspx "Insert XFN Hyperlink Plugin")
with his Insert XFN Hyperlink plugin for [Windows Live
Writer](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2006/08/24/89164.aspx "Windows Live Writer").

Apparently he was introduced to the concept of XFN after reading [a
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/02/01/Night_At_The_Roxbury_With_Mr._Subsonic.aspx "Meeting Rob Conery")
on my blog.

Yes, you have me to thank for this fine plugin (not to mention Scott who
actually did all the work, while dealing with a-holes like me trying to
take the credit).

It’s not yet available in the [Windows Live
Gallery](http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?l=8 "Windows Live Gallery"),
but will hopefully be there soon.

In the meanwhile, we’ll have to beg for a direct download.
