Thought I should take advantage of my latest bout of insomnia and do a
slight redesign of my website. My goal was to clean it up a bit so it
looks less crowded and cluttered.

I also removed the Flickr images because the script was slow to load and
caused my site to load slowly. I didn’t think it added a whole lot
anyways. I may look into creating a server-side flickr control later.

Here’s a screenshot, in case you’re reading this in an aggregator.

Let me know what you think of the design. My next step will be to focus
more on usability. If there’s anything that annoys you about my site
(here’s where [Jeff](http://codinghorror.com/blog/ "CodingHorror") will
chime in) do let me know.
