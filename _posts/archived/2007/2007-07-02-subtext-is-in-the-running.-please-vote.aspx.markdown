[![sf-cca-vote](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/SubtextIsInTheRunning.PleaseVote_1416C/sf-cca-vote_1.png)](http://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/vote.php?from=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fsubtext%252 "Vote for Subtext")
A little while ago I pleaded with my readers to [nominate Subtext for a
SourceForge Community Choice
Award](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/06/24/please-nominate-subtext-for-a-sourceforge-community-choice-award.aspx "Please Nominate Subtext").

The good news is that it worked! **Subtext is one of the finalists for a
Community Choice Award in two categories**:

-   **Best Project for Communications**: The best project for talking to
    your friends or sharing information. Other nominees include -
    Miranda, Pidgin, and FileZilla.\
-   **Most Collaborative Project**: The project most likely to accept
    your patches and value your input. Other nominees include - Azureus,
    XOOPS, and Zimbra.

That’s some heady competition we’re up against.

As far as I know, Subtext is one of only two .NET projects to be
nominated overall, the other being a corporate sponsored application
(*not that there’s anything wrong with that*).

### Why Am I Politicking This?

So here’s the deal. Competitions like this are not about choosing the
*actual* *best* project. There’s just no way that there are developers
out there who have worked on every project in these categories and knows
for a fact that
Subtext
communicates with its users better than FileZilla (*we do*).

I am fully aware that this is purely a popularity contest. Heck, I voted
for 7-Zip in almost every category because of how useful I find it, not
because I know for a fact that it has the *Best Technical Design (it
probably does)*.

As [I just
wrote](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/07/02/open-source-on-.net-is-not-an-oxymoron.aspx "Open Source on .NET Is Not An OxyMoron"),
I think that despite the short rift that .NET gets in the broader Open
Source Community, it is a great platform for Open Source development.

If you agree, please [vote for
Subtext](http://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/vote.php?from=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fsubtext%252 "Subtext")
and spread the word. I think it’d be neat to have a .NET project
(*especially one that starts with an "S"*) as a community choice winner.
Voting ends on July 20^th^. Thanks!
