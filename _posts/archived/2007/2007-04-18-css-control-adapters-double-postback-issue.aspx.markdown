My Coworker (and

Harman](http://stevenharman.net/blog/ "Steve Harman's Blog") writes
about a [weird double PostBack
issue](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/04/18/css-control-adapters-cause-double-postback-in-ie.aspx "Double Postback Issue")
he ran into recently when using CSS Friendly Control Adapters with the
CreateUserWizard Membership Provider control.

So far he hasn’t received much in the way of feedback in the
[forums](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/04/18/css-control-adapters-cause-double-postback-in-ie.aspx "Forums")
yet. Have any of you run into this?
