A while back I mentioned the beginning of phase 1 of my [total world
domination
plans](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/05/World_Domination_Phase_1_Commenced.aspx "World Domination Phase 1").
This morning at 3:55 AM, phase 1 is officially complete with the birth
of our son, Cody Yokoyama Haack, all seven pounds and fourteen ounces of
him.

First, the little dictator is ready to rule our household. Later, the
world! (*click to see larger*)

Actually, our affectionate nickname for Cody is “Little Thug” because of
the skull cap they gave him and for the way he likes to [mad
dog](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mad+dog "Mad Dog Definition on Urban Dictionary")
us. Here’s a [short little
video](https://haacked.com/assets/images/Cody_064.MPG "Video of Cody’s, the Little Thug")
to demonstrate.

Of course, he may have good reason to look upset at us, given these
incriminating photos.

We brought Cody home the same day that he was born. Cody’s momma is
doing just fine. From start to finish, the whole process took around 9
hours. It was fast, but furious. Fortunately, there were no
complications and my wife was able to deliver without the aid of any
drugs, which was her goal. Let’s just say I am in awe of her because I
was trying to get pain killers and I was just holding her hand.

It was a long night, but an amazing experience. The little guy is a
total trooper. When they pricked his heel to draw blood for various
tests, he grumbled a bit, but didn’t end up wailing as I expected. Of
course, thugs don’t wail.
