In my last post I mentioned that [Subkismet is ready to put a thumping
on comment
SPAM](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/06/12/introducing-subkismet-the-cure-for-comment-spam.aspx "Subkismet - The Cure For Comment Spam")
for your web applications. Unfortunately I didn’t have much in the way
of demo code.

Today, I have rectified that situation with a new site:
[http://subkismet.com/](http://subkismet.com/ "Subkismet Demos").
Currently, this is just a one-page site with demonstrations of the three
main spam fighting measures, along with source code.

I am really glad that I created this demo site because I realized [my
first
release](http://www.codeplex.com/subkismet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=4897 "First Release")
of Subkismet was incomplete and didn’t work. However, like Google, I
cowardly hid behind the *BETA* moniker as an excuse. But no longer,
everything is now working and the proof is in the demo.

If you download the latest source code, you’ll see that I’ve included
the source code for
[http://subkismet.com/](http://subkismet.com/ "Subkismet Demo") as a
separate web application project.

As we add new spam fighting kung fu to the library, we’ll keep the demo
site updated as a proof that the code actually works.
