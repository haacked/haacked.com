![microsoft-mvp](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/MicrosoftsRegretIsMyGainImanMVP_122F9/microsoft-mvp_thumb.png)I
received an email today informing me that I’ve been awarded the status
of Microsoft MVP in the *Visual Developer - ASP/ASP.NET* category. I was
aiming for an MVP for non-visual developers, but my [57
Lynx readers](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/11/18/to-the-57-lynx-users.aspx "To the 57 Lynx Users Last Month")
didn’t have enough clout to make that happen.

What does it mean to be a Microsoft MVP? I’m not really fully sure yet.
You can read the official blurb about [the program
here](http://www.microsoft.com/mvp "Microsoft MVP Program").

In general I think it means I get to use the above logo on my blog
and may start blogging about the problems with the MVP program and how
the standards aren’t what they used to be now that they let the
*riff-raff* in.

Remember kids. *Riff-raff* are the people they let into an organization
*after* you’ve been admitted.

In all seriousness though, I appreciate the honor and want to thank [Rob
Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery’s Blog") for initially
nominating me and [K. Scott
Allen](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/ "OdeToCode") for also
nominating me later.
