Last year when all the [hubbub surrounding
NDoc](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/07/26/TheDemiseOfNDocAndAChallengeForUsersOfOpenSourceSoftware.aspx "The Demise to NDoc and a challenge for OSS")
was happening, I tried to rally people around the idea of a **Contribute
to Open Source** day on July 26^th^.

Why July 26?

Because I happened to write that post on that day.

any case, it looks like Christmas will come early for some lucky open
source projects. Jeff Atwood of
[CodingHorror](http://www.codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror - programming and human factors")
fame is teaming up with Microsoft to [**donate \$10,000 in support of
open source .NET
projects**](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000894.html "Supporting Open Source in the Microsoft Ecosystem").

Go and nominate the open source project you find most useful in his
comments.

What has spurred this recent largesse? Jeff is finally accepting a
modest [advertisement on his
blog](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000893.html "How to advertise on your blog without selling out") which
will bring in enough revenue to help give back to the open source
community. The hope is to help remedy the fact that...

In the same manner that open source projects themselves are community
led initiatives, it’s great to see other initiatives like this sprout
from the community. While we may clamor for Microsoft to take a more
active role in fostering OSS in the Microsoft ecosystem, we don’t have
to wait around and do nothing in the meantime. We can take the lead like
these other initiatives.

-   [DotNetNuke OpenForce
    Conference](http://www.dotnetnuke.com/News/MediaReleases/DotNetNukeLeadsWayWithOpenForce07Conference/tabid/1087/Default.aspx "OpenForce Conference")

The good news is that Microsoft is showing itself to be supportive of
such initiatives not only in spirit, but also financially.
