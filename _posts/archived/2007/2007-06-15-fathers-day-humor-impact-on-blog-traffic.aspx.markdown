With Father’s Day fast approaching (June 17 this year), and now that I
have joined the hallowed ranks of fathers, I thought I’d have a little
fun writing about something I [posted on my blog two years
ago](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/06/13/funny-fathers-day-ad.aspx "The Funniest Father’s Day Ad Yet"),
but has recently popped up on my radar.

As a fan of dark humor, I thought this was rather clever and funny at
the time.

If you take a closer look at the comments, you’ll notice that there are
no comments from 2005. They all start in 2007. It turns out that at that
time, I didn’t have much traffic.

But recently, this post somehow found its way on
[StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/tag/fathers-day/ "Fathers Day Tag on StumbleUpon")
as well as a couple of other humor sites which drove a huge amount of
traffic to my blog. The following graph shows you the number of visits
per day.

As you can see, I enjoyed a brief spike in traffic, but things returned
pretty much to normal soon afterwards.

What’s interesting about this spike in traffic is that it follows the
traffic pattern that you hear about when a site is featured prominently
on Digg. In other words, what would you guess happened to the average
time on my site?

You got it. There was a corresponding dip. Well that makes sense, there
isn’t much to read so most users looked at it and moved on. Was there a
corresponding drop in the number of pages per visit?

[![pages] per

A slight dip, but not by much. Most visitors to my site view only one to
two pages at most per visit.

So there you go, if you want to drive traffic to your blog two years
from now, post something really really funny. But keep in mind that this
traffic is not *qualified* traffic in that it won’t likely convert to
new readers who actually enjoy the whole of your blog.

In general, I think it’s best to focus on building the type of traffic
you want. But if you have something truly funny to post, do share.
