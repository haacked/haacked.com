Fortune Magazine [published an
article](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/index.htm?section=money_latest "Microsoft Takes on the Free World")
in which they describe how Microsoft claims that free software, such as
Linux, violates 235 of its patents.

Some key snippets (emphasis mine):

> gets its way, free software won’t be free anymore.

> friendly visits to its Fortune 500 customers, seeking direct licenses.

The article points out that Microsoft doesn’t make any specific patent
claims. They simply break the number down into categories.

> But he does break down the total number allegedly violated - 235 -

I understand that Microsoft is a business and has a duty to its
shareholders and the right to protect its patents. ***But the question I
ask here is whether this is a good idea?** Is this really a good
strategy to meet its fiduciary duty? Will this keep its shareholders,
customers, and developers happy?*

**At the moment, I don’t think this is a wise move.** I’m not a patent
expert so there is no point in me arguing on the validity of their
patent claims, so I won’t. I will try to reserve judgment concerning the
areas I am not well informed about. Instead, I want to focus on the
negative perception of such a move for Microsoft and the potential
effects of that.

On the face of it, given the recent pact [between Novell and
Microsoft](http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/community_open_letter.html "Open Letter to the Community from Novell"),
this seems like a transparent attempt to scare other Linux distributors
into forming their own pacts with Microsoft. This perception of bullying
certainly doesn’t help Microsoft’s image, which had been on the mend in
the last few years.

Not only that, but by executing such a move, Microsoft will find it hard
to avoid the charge of hypocrisy by its critics considering how
Microsoft itself has been the victim of patent trolling in various
lawsuits such as the [EOLAS
case](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+loses+in+Eolas+patent+ruling/2100-1012_3-5885657.html "Microsoft loses in the Eolas patent ruling")
and the more recent [Vertical Computer Systems lawsuit over
.NET](http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/04/20/HNmsdotnetpatentsuit_1.html "Microsoft hit with patent suit over .NET").

Given the recent [Supreme Court rulings around patent
trolling](http://www.forbes.com/home/businessinthebeltway/2006/05/15/ebay-scotus-patent-ruling-cx_jh_0516scotus.html "Supreme Court Buries Patent Trolls"),
this announcement seems especially poorly timed. Microsoft appears to be
trying to have it both ways, fighting against silly patents on the one
hand while threatening enforcement of patents with the other.

Again, I do not *know* that Microsoft is engaging in hypocrisy or patent
trolling. I am merely focused on the perception of their actions. I
can’t claim that Microsoft is patent trolling because I don’t know
whether these patent claims are legitimate. And that’s part of the
problem. Nobody knows yet.

By not addressing specifics, Microsoft is not opening its patents to
challenge. So while they might not be patent trolling in this case, they
certainly are (whether intentionally or not) creating an environment of
fear, uncertainty, and doubt for the ecosystems that have grown around
these open source projects.

This at a time when Microsoft seemed to really be warming to Open
Source. At the Mix07 conference, I really got the sense that developers
and program managers at Microsoft are really starting to embrace the
Open Source Software and how it fits into the Microsoft ecosystem.

This may be indicative of a disconnect within the Microsoft ranks. It
seems that the new wave of Microsoft employees, especially many of their
developers and Program managers, see Open Source as a way to enhance and
generate value around the Microsoft .NET development platform.
Meanwhile, it appears that the old wave of Microsoft executives and its
legal department cannot look beyond the potential threat that OSS *might
be* to Microsoft and smell opportunity.

**This points to another potential negative effect of this strategy -
*potential developer discontent within and outside the company*.**
Microsoft’s recent attempt to stifle Office 2007 ribbon look alikes
pushed Mike Gunderloy from the ranks of being a relative proponent of
Microsoft to deciding to [completely leave the Microsoft
universe](http://www.afreshcup.com/2006/12/9/what-s-going-on-here "What’s Going On Here?").
*Could this announcement have a similar effect on other developers and
hurt Microsoft’s ongoing competition with Google in retaining the best
and the brightest?*It remains to be seen.

As I said in a [recent
interview](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/01/mix07-i-am-a-terrible-at-being-interviewed.aspx "I am terrible at being interviewed"),
I firmly believe that the .NET platform is a fantastic environment for
developing open source software. I also believe that these myriad of
open source projects built with .NET benefits Microsoft immensely. So
this recent news about Microsoft’s Patent fight just leaves me
scratching my head, not because I don’t think they have the right to
defend their patents, but because I wonder if it’s really the smart
thing to do at this time.

In any case, at the very least, I hope they don’t use the RIAA as a
model of strategic brilliance and start suing their own customers. Now
that, I can unilaterally claim, would be a bad move.

What are your thoughts on this? Am I off base and uninformed, or do I
make a good case here?
