I [wrote about
this](http://www.koders.com/blog/?p=72 "Searching source code on Koders.com with C#")
on my company’s blog, but thought I’d mention it here since I assume not
everyone has jumped at the chance to subscribe to [that
blog](http://www.koders.com/blog/ "Koders Blog") (go on, it won’t bite)
;)

[Simone
Busoli](http://dotnetslackers.com/community/blogs/simoneb/ "Simone Busoli")
wrote a pretty cool API to query open source code via Koders.com by
leveraging the [ASP.NET RSS
Toolkit](http://www.codeplex.com/ASPNETRSSToolkit "ASP.NET RSS Toolkit").
Read more about it at [his
blog](http://dotnetslackers.com/community/blogs/simoneb/archive/2007/05/22/Searching-source-code-on-Koders.com.aspx#comments "Searching Source Code on Koders.com").
