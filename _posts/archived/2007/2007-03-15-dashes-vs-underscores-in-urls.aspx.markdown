I used to think the choice of using dashes vs underscores to separate
words in an URL was simply a matter of personal preference. Nothing more
than a [religious
choice](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000699.html "Religious Choice").

Personally, I preferred underscores because I felt dashes *intruded*
upon the words while underscores stayed at the bottom out of the way. So
much so I had originally made that the default URL scheme in Subtext for
friendly URLs and was using that myself.

It wasn’t till recently that I learned this debate [has already been
resolved](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/ "Dashes vs Underscores").
Years ago.

I wouldn’t say *resolved* really. Just that, there appears to be a
really good reason to choose dashes over underscores. Apparently, Google
sees the dash as a word separator, while the underscore is perceived to
be part of the word. Something to do with being able to search for C++
style constant variables SUCH\_AS\_THIS in the title of a post.

**The question is, does this still apply today? Does it**[**even
matter**](http://www.simoncox.com/mt3/2006/06/dashes_vs_underscores.php "Does it matter")**?**

To be on the safe side, I'm falling in line for now. Or rather, in dash.
What are your thoughts?
