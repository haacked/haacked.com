A while back, [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway's Blog") asked
the question, [Can Operating Systems tell if they’re running in a
Virtual
Machine](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/10/27/Can-Operating-Systems-tell-if-they_2700_re-running-in-a-Virtual-Machine_3F00_.aspx "Can OS tell if they're living in the matrix")?
What a silly question! When was the last time an Operating System
questioned its own existence? Is that going to be in the next version of
Windows - *Windows Vista Into Its Own Soul*? Or perhaps Apple will come
out with *Mac OS Existentialist*?

Perhaps a more interesting question is whether or not you can tell that
a web server is running in a virtual machine? Last weekend I migrated my
blog into a virtual server running on a [pretty sweet
host](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000984.html "Virtual Machine Server Hosting")
machine and so far, my site seems to have gained an extra spring in its
step.

Given that it’s hosted on the same server as that bandwidth hog,
[CodingHorror.com](http://codinghorror.com/ "Coding Horror"), I’m very
pleased with the performance thus far. At least until he gets Dugged
again.

In Jeff’s post, he mentioned that
[CrystalTech](http://crystaltech.com/?uid=100 "CrystalTech") hooked us
up with a beefy 64-bit dedicated server. Several commenters noted that
there was no 64-bit offering on their site. The reason is that they
hadn’t received much demand for 64-bit servers until we came along with
our bullying tactics.

[![Dedicated Dual & Quad
Core](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/MyBlogLivesInTheMatrix_96C/PROMO-dualcore_3.jpg)](http://crystaltech.com/dedicated-windows.aspx?uid=100 "CrystalTech Dedicated")
Through a contact over there, I wanted to see if we could work out a
hosting deal. Jeff was adamant that we get a 64-bit server, which they
didn’t have at the time, but could certainly order. I pretty much didn’t
want them to go through all that trouble and was ready to move on, but
they insisted it was not a big deal.

They ~~lied~~...er...understated their case. Rather than simply build a
single 64-bit server, they took this as an opportunity to build out a
whole new product offering of [64 bit dedicated
servers](http://crystaltech.com/dedicated-windows.aspx?uid=100 "CrystalTech Dedicated Servers").

So what started off as me trying to scam some discounted or free hosting
ended up spurring these guys to start a new product offering. Nice!

I’m now hosting this site and
[SubtextProject.com](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project") on
this box, but our CCNET server is still in a virtual machine hosted
generously by [Eric Kemp](http://monk.thelonio.us/ "Eric Kemp") of
Subsonic fame.

I used to be skeptical of hosting my site in a virtual machine, as I
felt like if I hosted closer to the metal, I could wring out extra
performance. But let’s get real here, I’m not taxing this machine in any
way.

I’m sold on the [benefits and
convenience](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000491.html "Our Virtual Machine Future")
of virtualization.
