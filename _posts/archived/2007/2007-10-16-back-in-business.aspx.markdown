Many of you noticed that my blog was down. Thanks for the heads up. For
some reason, it was pegging the CPU at 100% all of a sudden. Not sure
why this was happening since nobody made any changes to the server. At
least no changes they would fess up to ;).

I migrated the blog to a dedicated server courtesy of [Rob
Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery's Blog") and still had the
problem. Migrating allowed me to narrow down the problem without
affecting anyone else’s site.

After much trial and error, I narrowed it down to the Recent Comments
and Recent Posts controls in the footer of my skin. If you scroll down,
you’ll see I’ve removed them.

So again, thanks for those who pointed it out and sorry to anyone who
was inconvenienced (like me!) looking for information etc....
