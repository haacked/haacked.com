[Simone Chiaretta](http://codeclimber.net.nz/ "Simone Chiaretta"), a
member of the Subtext development team (among other open source
projects), has been quite busy lately. I recently mentioned the [Vista
Sidebar Gadget for
CruiseControl.NET](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/04/16/vista-gadget-to-monitor-your-build.aspx "Vista Gadget for CCNET")
he published. He also was recently in a [video interview by
MindBlog](http://www.mindscape.co.nz/blog/?p=28 "MindBlog"). Go Simo!

The post that caught my eye recently is how to make a [Gmail-like
loading indicator with ASP.NET
Ajax](http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2007/05/17/How-to-make-a-Gmail-like-loading-indicator-with-ASP.NET-Ajax.aspx "GMail Like Loading Indicator").
This is a nice demonstartion of how to use the ASP.NET Ajax library to
simulate various styles of user interface.

Personally though, I’m not a fan of this particular loading indicator at
the page level. When I have my browser fully expanded, I sometimes don’t
notice it. However, it works great when constrained to a box, such as
the corner of a login box.
