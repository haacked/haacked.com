In order to promote the book [Windows Developer Power Tools:
*Turbocharge Windows Development with More Than 140 Free and Open Source
Tools*](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Developer-Power-Tools-Turbocharge/dp/0596527543 "Windows Developer PowerTools"),
O’Reilly is declaring January 19^th^ (aka today) to be “Windows
Developer Tools Day”.

I think declaring days will become a bigger trend in 2007. I’ve tried my
hand at declaring July 26^th^ to be “[Contribute to Open Source
Day](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/07/26/TheDemiseOfNDocAndAChallengeForUsersOfOpenSourceSoftware.aspx "Contribute to Open Source Day")”.
Jeff Atwood declared December 1^st^ to be “[Support Your Favorite Small
Software Vendor
Day](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000735.html "Support Your Favorite Small Software Vendor Day")”.

**Now we can add Windows Developer Tools Day to that geek calendar.**

As I [mentioned
before](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/07/13/TheMustReadBookOfTheSummer.aspx "Must Read Book Of The Summer"),
I contributed a couple of sections to the book–The section on
TortoiseSVN and TortoiseCVS and the section on
Subtext of
course.

I’m genuinely looking forward to receiving my copy of this book for the
many useful tools that are presented inside. Not only that, some of our
clients are starting to migrate towards using Subversion, for which
we’re providing some rudimentary training.

It’ll be helpful to tell them to buy this book and read my section on
TortoiseSVN.

I believe the book also covers CruiseControl.NET. CruiseControl.NET has
been an extremely valuable tool for [Subtext’s continous integration and
build
process](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/05/18/HowSubtextUsesCruiseControl.NET.aspx "CruiseControl.NET").
The next step for some of our clients is to help them devote a server
and time to setting up a continous integration process.
