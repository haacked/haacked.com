UPDATE: You can now subscribe to my feed [via
email](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=527603 "subscribe via email").
This is a service offering from Feedburner. Sweet!

![Flame from
Feedburner.com](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/BurningMyFeeds_C99B/flamocon_190h%5B9%5D.gif)I’ve
decided to make the jump and switch to Feedburner after the [glowing
recommendation](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000807.html "Reducing Website Bandwidth")
from [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "Jeff Atwood").
However, being the paranoid sort, I decided to go ahead and pay for the
[MyBrand PRO
feature](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/mybrand;jsessionid=90DFA112C8BFE3762618061519CF877F.fb1 "MyBrand Overview and FAQ").

This allows me to keep control over my feed by serving it from my own
domain
[http://feeds.haacked.com/haacked/](http://feeds.haacked.com/haacked/).
Not that I don’t trust FeedBurner, but if I ever want to take my feed
back in-house, it’ll be a lot easier for me to change a DNS setting than
to wait for them to perform a 301 redirect back to me.

If you’re reading this in your aggregator, my guess is that everything
is working fine. If not, please do let me know if you encounter any
problems. Flame on!
