[Tim Heuer](http://timheuer.com/blog/ "Tim Heuer’s Blog") has been on a
tear lately submitting some great new skins to the [Subtext Skin
Showcase](http://subtextskins.com/Home/SkinShowcase/tabid/156/Default.aspx "Subtext Skin Showcase"),
which is part of
[SubtextSkins.com](http://subtextskins.com/ "Subtext Skins Site").

The Showcase is the part of the site in which we display user submitted
skins and allow others to download the skins. The other part of the site
displays the default skins in Subtext.

It appears that Tim has been porting some of the nicer designs in the
[Open Designs](http://opendesigns.org/ "Open Source Website Designers")
website, a website devoted to open source web design.

Tim happens to also be the creator of
[Origami](http://www.subtextskins.com/tabid/155/grm2id/1/Default.aspx "Origami")
(which you can see in use on [Rob Conery’s
Blog](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery’s Blog")), which many
consider to be the nicest skin in Subtext.

If you are a Subtext user, try out some of these skins. They may find
their way into future releases of Subtext.
