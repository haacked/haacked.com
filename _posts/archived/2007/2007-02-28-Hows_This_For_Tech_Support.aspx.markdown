[Micah Dylan](http://micahdylan.com/ "Micah Dylan") (CEO of
[VelocIT](http://veloc-it.com/ "My Company")) writes about a [tech
support
call](http://micahdylan.com/archive/2007/03/01/Microsoft-Did-It.aspx "Tech Support With Comcast")
he had with Comcast, the local cable company.

To sum (though you should go [read
it](http://micahdylan.com/archive/2007/03/01/Microsoft-Did-It.aspx "Tech Support Call"))
Micah can’t login to the Comcast website and the tech support guy tells
him to call Microsoft claiming it’s a problem with the browser!

Comcast Really?! You expect your customer to call Microsoft and
singlehandedly convince them to update their browser so it works with
your website, rather than following the lead of millions of other
websites and making the website work with the browser?
