Run, don’t walk, over to [.NET
Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/ ".NET Rocks") and download their
[interview with yours
truly](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=261 "Phil Haack") (as
in me, not any other *yours truly*).

I had a real blast chatting with Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell. We
covered all my favorite topics (well except soccer) which include
Software Development, Open Source, and
Subtext!

I’m still here in Redmond on the Microsoft campus so I haven’t had the
cringeworthy experience of listening to myself talk. ;)
