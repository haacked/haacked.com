My friend [Scott
Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman’s Blog") is on a
mission to raise $50,000 and then some for the American Diabetes
Association to help fund the search for a cure.

If you don’t know Scott, you should definitely subscribe to his blog.

His blog is has a wealth of information on software development,
diabetes, .NET, and other topics.

He’s given much to the community over the years through his blog,
podcast, Open Source projects, etc....

*Interesting little tidbit: When I first started to take blogging I set
a goal for myself. Setting a goal was my way of taking blogging more
seriously. I surveyed the blog landscape and said to myself, “Hmmm, this
Hanselman dude has a pretty popular blog. I want my blog to be as well
known as that guy someday.”, not realizing at the time just how big a
target I chose. His blog was an inspiration for mine, and many others
I'm sure.*

I’m far from reaching that goal, but along the way I have become friends
with Scott (as well as a friendly rival with our competing open source
projects, though we cross-contribute more than we compete). This past
Mix07 I finally met the guy in person and he’s a laugh a minute.
