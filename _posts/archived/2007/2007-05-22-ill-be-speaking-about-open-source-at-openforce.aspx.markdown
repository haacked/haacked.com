I’ve been invited to participate on a couple of panels at the upcoming
[DotNetNuke OpenForce
'07](http://www.dotnetnukecorp.com/Events/OpenForce07/tabid/73/Default.aspx "OpenForce '07")
conference, November 5-8 in Las Vegas.

-   .NET Open Source Panel with Scott Guthrie
-   .NET Open Source Architectures Panel

I’m pretty excited to be on the same panel as
[ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/ "Scott Guthrie") himself, the
man who never sleeps. Both of the panels I am on are focused on Open
Source on the .NET platform, something I love to talk about. Well that
and [Subtext](http://www.subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website").

**So what is the DotNetNuke OpenForce conference?**

This is a DotNetNuke conference (so DotNetNuke sessions are emphasized),
but with a bigger focus than just DotNetNuke. Keeping true to its roots,
they want to help expand the visibility of other open source projects on
the .NET platform.

Towards that goal, DotNetNuke created the OpenForce concept which will
provide a conference venue for some of the largest .NET open source
projects. This is a way for open source projects to band together,
showcase their technology, and exchange ideas and support.

This conference will be co-located with the [ASP.NET
Connections](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/FALL2007ASP/default.asp?s=101 "ASP.NET Connections")
conference, so I’ll be able to attend sessions at both. So if you’re
going to be at either conference, leave me a comment!

And I’ll do my best to keep the "[You
Knows](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/01/mix07-i-am-a-terrible-at-being-interviewed.aspx "You Knows")"
to a minimum. If you’re there, feel free to keep a scorecard.
