It is with great pleasure and relief that I announce the release of
Subtext 1.9.5. Between you and me, I’m just happy to get this release
out before [the kid is
born](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/05/World_Domination_Phase_1_Commenced.aspx "World Domination Plans").

As with most point releases, this is primarily a bug fix release, but we
found time to introduce a few nice new features - most notably support
for tagging and
[Identicons](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2007/01/19/identicon-explained "Identicons").

### New Features

-   **Content Tagging and Tag Cloud -** for more details, refere to
    [this
    post](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/11/tagging-in-subtext.aspx "Tagging In Subtext"). 
-   **Identicon Support** - Uses the [Identicon Handler
    project](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/03/19/identicon-handler-for-.net-on-codeplex.aspx "Identicon Handler on CodePlex")
    on CodePlex.
-   **MyBrand Feedburner Support** - Updated our FeedBurner
    implementation to support custom feedburner URLs
-   **Upgrade to**[**LightBox
    2.0**](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/ "Lightbox 2")
    - If you referenced the default lightbox skin in your custom skin,
    please reference [this
    post](http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2007/05/11/Breaking-change-in-Subtext-1.9.5-update-your-custom-skins.aspx "Update your custom skin")
    by Simone to understand how to update the skin.
-   **Author CSS Class** - The CSS class of "author" is added to
    comments left by the owner of a blog (must be logged in when leaving
    comment for this to work). This allows custom skin authors to
    highlight comments by authors.
-   **Credits Page** - In the Admin section, we give credit where credit
    is due, displaying a list of the open source products we make use of
    in building Subtext.
-   **Implemented ASP.NET AJAX** - We replaced MagicAjax panel
    with ASP.NET Ajax libraries. Keep in mind that this requires a bit
    of new Web.config configuration sections. So be careful when merging
    your Web.config changes.

### Bug Fixes

    - This bug bears special mention as it was a real pain to track down
    the root cause.

### Clean Installation

A clean install of Subtext is relatively painless. Essentially copy all
the files to your webserver, create a database if you don’t already have
one, update web.config to point to your database, and you’re all set.
For more details on the setup instructions, read the [Clean Installation
Instructions](http://www.subtextproject.com/Home/About/Docs/Installation/tabid/111/Default.aspx "Clean Installation Instructions")

### Upgrading

Upgrading from a previous 1.9 version is relatively straightforward. For
the safest approach, follow the [upgrade instructions
here](http://www.subtextproject.com/Home/About/Docs/Upgrading/tabid/147/Default.aspx "Upgrading Subtext").

I’ve written a command line tool for upgrading Subtext, but it isn’t
production ready yet. Our goal is to make the upgrade process as
seamless as possible in future versions. If you’d like to help with
that, we’d love to have your contributions!

### Download

As always, you can [**download the latest release
here**](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137896 "Download").
The *install* file contains just the files you need to deploy to your
webserver. The *source* file contains full source code.

### Thanks!

As always, many thanks go out to the many Subtext contributors and
community members who helped make this latest release possible. Subtext
keeps on getting better because of the community involvement. Just take
a look at the improvements to our [Continous Integration and Build
Server](http://build.subtextproject.com/ccnet/) as an example.

If you’d like to contribute, we’re always looking for help. [Great
positions are
open](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/03/Seriously_Cool_Jobs_Available.aspx "Cool Jobs Available")!

**What’s Next?**

I’m wrapping up a project for a client in which I was able to implement
multiple authors per blog. Hopefully, this means that Subtext 2.0 won’t
take as long to release as 1.9.5 did.

We are constantly improving our development process and refactoring the
code. The big push for 2.0 is to get the Plugin Model and custom
MembershipProvider rock solid and to refactor and clean up the code
heavily.
