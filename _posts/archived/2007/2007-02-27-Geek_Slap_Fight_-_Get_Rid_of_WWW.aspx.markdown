Forget flame wars. They’re so USENET. The new way of geek fighting is
much more subtle.

![Subtlety of a blow

Recently [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "friend")
wrote a post on the [SEO implications of URL
standardization](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GooglePageRanksConsideredSubtle.aspx "Google PageRanks Considered Subtle")
which [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "Dorkwad")
followed up with his post on [URL Rewriting to prevent Duplicate
URLs](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000797.html "Url Rewriting").

Jeff makes it known that he prefers that his blog be referenced with the
“www.” in the front. I think that’s an unnecessary three characters that
is quite dated. Yes, we **know** your blog is on the **World Wide Web**.
The World Wide Web is no longer a nice new shiny bauble. You can feel
free to drop the *www.*

Besides, your domain name will sort better without it.

And for those who say: *But if you hit CTRL+ENTER in the address bar,
it’ll surround what you type with “www.” and “.com”* I saw bah! If I
want to go to Jeff’s blog, I can type *c-o-d* and hit tab and I’m there.
A modern browser is pretty handy for that with that newfangled auto
complete.

Anyways, in this [recent
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/02/27/Why_Cant_Programmers._Read.aspx "Why Programmer’s Can’t Read")
on the reading habits of programmers, I linked to a post of Jeff’s
without the “www.”, which did not go unnoticed by Jeff nor [LazyCoder
Scott](http://www.lazycoder.com/ "LazyCoder") (thanks for pointing out
the jab Scott, it might’ve gone under his radar damnit! A nice
subversive jab at the *man*.)

Responding with a geek equivalent of “Oh no you di’int”, Jeff’s [very
next
post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000804.html "FizzBuzz: The Programmer’s Stairway to Heaven"),
he returns the favor. Touché my friend! Touché. Well I’ve hidden a
little something for you in this post. Oh yeah. Bring it on.

Aren’t we just so pathetic?

*P.S. Jeff now flinches if you threaten to Digg his blog.*
