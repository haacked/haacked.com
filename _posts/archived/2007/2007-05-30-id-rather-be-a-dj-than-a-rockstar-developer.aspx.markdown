With all this talk of rockstar programmers, I like [Ron
Evan’s](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/ "Ron Even’s Blog")
take when he says, “[I Would Rather Be A Jazz
Programmer](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/05/i-would-rather-be-jazz-programmer.html "Jazz Programmer")”.

> Here are some differences, as I see them:
>
> Rockstar
> - One bit hit song, then disappears
> - Embarrass themselves as they age
> - Claims they wrote the song
> - Keeps trying to get back that sound they used to have
> - Gets back together with the old band after unsuccessful solo
> careers
> - Wants to marry a model and have a movie cameo
> - Won’t play without a contract and advance payment
>
> Jazzer
> - One big hit, and they become an influencer
> - Get cooler with age
> - Claims the song is just a cool arrangement of a standard
> - Keeps trying to produce a new sound
> - Records with a variety of musicians over time
> - Wants to become a professor at Berkeley School of Music
> - Jams on the street corner just because they feel like it

While I like some rock bands such as U2 and I like some Jazz, my
favorite music falls under the umbrella of
[Electronica](http://www.di.fm/edmguide/edmguide.html "Ishkur’s Guide to Electronic Music")
including, but not limited to, BreakBeat, Trance, House, Trip-Hop,
Electro, Jungle and Downtempo.

It occurred to me that I would rather be a DJ programmer than any of
these.

Here are some reasons why:

-   Never suffer from the *Not Invented Here* syndrome.
-   Are masters of re-use, to a fault.
-   The best do produce new music from scratch when they see a specific
    need that isn’t being addressed by already existing music.
-   Are great at mash-ups and integrating parts of multiple songs to
    create a new and more interesting song, aka a remix.
-   The best get paid a lot for a couple of hours of easy work. How hard
    is it to spin some vinyl, CDs, or audio files from a laptop as some
    do now?

At the very least, I would like to be paid like a DJ. Not the guy at
your local dive, I’m talking about the big names who get paid $50K for
three hours of work. What kind of music reflects your coding style?
