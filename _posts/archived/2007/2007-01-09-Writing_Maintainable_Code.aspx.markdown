[Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/ "Jeremy Miller's Blog on CodeBetter Blogs")
believes that among the various beneficial and important qualities a
codebase can have, the single most important quality of code is
maintainability. I totally agree, having spent many hours maintaining
legacy code written years ago as well as code I wrote a week ago.

**As soon as a line of code is typed on the screen, it becomes
legacy.**You are now maintaining that code.

According to Robert L. Glass in [*Facts and Fallacies of Software
Engineering*](http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fallacies-Software-Engineering-Robert/dp/0321117425 "Book on Amazon"),
research shows that **maintenance typically consumes from 40 to 80
percent of software costs**, typically making it the dominant life cycle
phase of a software project.

Fortunately, Jeremy has your back. He’s written a multi-part
treatise/manifesto on writing maintainable code. Some of the posts are a
bit longer than your typical *skim it while reading blogs during a
compile* entry, but are well worth reading.

Print them out, sit back with a fine glass of scotch, and savor the
excellent knowledge he imparts.

I look forward to the next post in the series.
