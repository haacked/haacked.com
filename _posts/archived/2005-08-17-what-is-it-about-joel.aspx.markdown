After reading over my [last blog
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/08/18/9536.aspx), I wondered why
my posts take such a virulent tone towards Joel Spolsky when I think
he’s wrong. Looking around the web, I noticed I am not [the only
one](http://www.lazycoder.com/weblog/index.php/archives/2005/08/18/why-are-people-still-listening-to-joel/).

I mean, I’ve never met the guy. He hasn’t killed any puppies that I know
of, nor has he insulted my mother. In fact, I am pretty sure he doesn’t
even know my mother.

Then I read this snippet of a [great
comment](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/08/18/9536.aspx#9538) from
[Melissa](http://blogginmynoggin.blogspot.com/) in my blog...

That’s it! Joel is an authority in topics of software, and like it or
not, authority carries with it power, which carries with it
responsibility (*thanks Uncle Ben*). He writes that BDUF is absolutely
necessary, and suddenly hundreds of software middle managers across the
country are thwarting their teams efforts to engage agile methodologies.

“If Joel says BDUF, then we do BDUF. We’re bringing back *Ye olde
Waterfall Methodology*.

So it’s not that I think he’s wrong, it’s that he is so forcibly and
authoritatively wrong. I’d love for him to try and make BDUF work with
some of my current clients. A few weeks into it and I’d have to have the
straight jacket and padded room reserved (*Lord knows I’ve had a stay
there*).

So that explains my harsh attitude. Well... that and the arrogant tone
he takes. That seems to get my dire up. Especially when [he put down
corporate developers](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/07/26/9027.aspx).

In any case, one post mentioned why anyone is still reading Joel. Well
as much as I like to get my panties in a bunch when he says something
stupid, 99% of his writings are still top notch insightful and
worthwhile. In every position I’ve been in, I would circulate links to
various articles he has written to help improve software development
practices. 99% of the time, he knows his stuff. It’s that 1% of the time
I wish he’d just shut up.
