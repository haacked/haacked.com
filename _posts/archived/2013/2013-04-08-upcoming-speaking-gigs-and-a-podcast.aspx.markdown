Someone recently emailed me to ask if I’m speaking at any upcoming
conferences this year. Good question!

I’ve been keeping it pretty light this year since my family and I are
doing a bit of travelling ourselves and I like spending time with them.

But I will be hitting up two conferences that I know of.

[&lt;anglebrackets&gt; April 8 – 11](http://anglebrackets.org/)
------------------------------------------------------------

Ohmagerd! That’s **this week! I better prepare!**

I’ll be giving two talks this week. One of them will be a joint talk
with the incomparable [Scott Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/). Usually
that means him taking potshots at me for your enjoyment. ARE YOU NOT
ENTERTAINED?!

You will be!

### Jazz Up Your Open Source with GitHub

*Wednesday April 10 3:30 PM – 4:45 PM - Room 5 (Just Me)*

> You write some code that handles angle brackets like nobody’s business
> and you're ready to share it with the world on GitHub. Great! Now
> what?
>
> The story doesn't end there. When the first users and contributors
> show up at your doorstep, you need to be prepared. Find out some tips
> for engaging an audience with your open source project and really make
> your project sing.

### Return of the HaaHa Show: How to Open Source

*Thursday April 11 8:00 AM (HWHAT!?) – 9:00 AM – Keynote Room 2 – Scott
and Phil*

> They are back. ScottHa and PhilHaa reprise their legendary (OK, not
> really) HaaHa show that has thrilled audiences on three continents.
> There will be code. There will be jokes, bad ones. There will be Pull
> Requests. There will be Markdown. Will there be injuries? Papercuts?
> Let’s find out as we join Phil Haack and Scott Hanselman as they learn
> how to open source. We will answer questions like: How do I get
> involved in open source? How do I clone and repro, branch it, do a
> pull request and commit to an open source project? Seems kind of hard.
> Let’s see if it is!

[MonkeySpace 2013 July 22-25](http://monkeyspace.org)
-----------------------------------------------------

The [call for proposals](http://monkeyspace.org/call/) for this
conference is still open. If you know anyone who might bring a diverse
and unique perspective to this conference, please encourage them to
submit. We’d really love to get a more diverse speaker cast than is
typical for a conference on .NET open source. This conference is *no
longer just a conference on Mono*. Mono figures prominently, but the
scope has expanded to the broader topic of .NET open source and cross
platform .NET.

Others
------

I’ll be in Tokyo Japan in late April. So if you have a user group there
that meets on Tuesday 4/30 and want to hear about GitHub, Git, NuGet, or
even ASP.NET MVC, let me know. I’d be happy to swing by, but be warned I
do not speak Japanese.

There might also be some local upcoming conferences I’ll speak at.

Podcasts
--------

I recently was a [guest on Yet Another Podcast with Jesse
Liberty](http://jesseliberty.com/2013/04/02/yet-another-podcast-94phil-haack-git/)
where I talked about Git, GitHub, GitHub for Windows, and subverting the
oppressive traditional hierarchical organizational structure that serves
to keep us down. FIGHT THE POWER!

Check it out.
