Next week Microsoft hosts its annual [MVP
Summit](http://www.2012mvpsummit.com/ "MVP Summit"). So what better time
for me to host [my first GitHub Drinkup – MVP Edition at the Tap House
Grill](https://github.com/blog/1059-bellevue-wa-drinkup "GitHub Drinkup Bellevue")!

Not an MVP? Nonsense! You are in my book, so show up! If you are an MVP,
you’re still welcome to slum it with the rest of us schlubs.

All the details are posted over at the [**GitHub Blog
post**](https://github.com/blog/1059-bellevue-wa-drinkup "Bellevue Drinkup").

What is a “Drinkup” you ask?
----------------------------

It’s pretty simple. It’s a meetup where we drink and share stories of
valor in the face of code complexity. Or jabber on about whatever else
software developers want to geek out about.

Getting together and sharing a brew or two is deeply ingrained in the
[GitHub
culture](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github/all/1 "Lord of the Files: Wired.com article on GitHub").
After all, [GitHub was
conceived](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html "How I Turned Down $300,000 from Microsoft to go Full-Time on GitHub")
over a beer at a bar.

If you’re not in the Seattle/Bellevue area, GitHub hosts a monthly (more
or less) drinkup in San Francisco where the GitHub HQ is located. We
also host the occasional drinkup all over the world when we attend
conferences in various locations.

So come on out, unwind, and let me buy you a beer. Perhaps this drinkup
will be the one where you’ll [meet your next
cofounder](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/03/how-to-meet-your-next-cofounder.html "Meet your next cofounder").
At the very least, you’ll enjoy some good drink and good conversation.

.NET Startup Group March 8
--------------------------

And if you can’t come out on Tuesday, I’ll also be speaking at the [.NET
Startup group on March
8](http://www.dotnetstartup.com/events/51574692/?eventId=51574692&action=detail ".NET Startup")
on GitHub, Git and making it all work on Windows. I might throw in a
dash of NuGet in there since I can’t help myself. There’s still plenty
of seats available.
