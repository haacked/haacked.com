As a kid, I was an impatient little brat. On any occasion that required
waiting, I became Squirmy Wormy until I pushed my dad to make the demand
parents so often make of fidgety kids, “*Sit still!*”

Recent evidence suggests a rejoinder to kids today in response to this
command, “*What!? Are you trying to kill me?!*”

There is compelling evidence that modern workers propensity to sit for
prolonged periods every day makes them fat and shortens their lives.
Hmmm, you wouldn’t happen to know any professions where sitting limply
at a desk for long periods of time is common, would you?

Yeah, me too.

This spurred me to learn more which led me to The Daily Infographic’s
[great summary of this
research](http://dailyinfographic.com/sitting-down-is-killing-you-infographic "Sitting down is killing you").
Seriously, click on the image below. I could have stopped there and
called it a post. But as always, I don’t know when to stop.

Much has been written about the detrimental health effects of
inactivity. According to Marc Hamilton, a biomedical researcher, sitting
down [shuts off your fat
burning](http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0610-stand_up_for_your_health.htm "stand up for your health").

> Physiologists analyzing obesity, heart disease, and diabetes found

> enzyme called lipase.

The same Hamilton goes into more details in this interesting NY Times
article on the potential lethality of prolonged sitting,

> This is your body on chairs: Electrical activity in the muscles drops

> says — leading to a cascade of harmful metabolic effects. Your

In other words, sitting down is the off button.

This [LifeHacker
article](http://lifehacker.com/5879536/how-sitting-all-day-is-damaging-your-body-and-how-you-can-counteract-it "How sitting all day is damaging your body.")
points out that the the long term health effects of sitting multiple
hours a day go way beyond weight gain.

I want all kinds of life years, but the “quality adjusted” variety
sounds extra special.

You might think that you’ll be just fine because you exercise the
recommended 30 minutes a day, but [a study from the British Journal of
Sports
Medicine](http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/43/2/81.full "Too much sitting: a novel and important predictor of chronic disease risk?")
notes that’s not the case.

That’s particularly disheartening. All that other exercise you do might
not counteract all the prolonged sitting.

Get up, stand up! Stand up for your code!
-----------------------------------------

*With apologies to Bob Marley*

**So what’s a developer to do?** Note that these studies put an emphasis
on *prolonged*. The simple solution is to stop sitting for *prolonged*
periods at a time. Get up at least once an hour and move!

But developers are interesting creatures. We easily get in the zone on a
problem and focus so deeply that three hours pass in a blink. Ironically
this wasn’t a problem I faced as a Program Manager since I was moving
from meeting to meeting nearly every hour.

But in my new job, writing code at home, I knew I needed more than an
egg timer to tell me to move every hour. I want to move constantly if I
can. For example, the way you do when you stand. So I looked into
adjustable desks.

According to Alan Hedge, director of Cornell’s Human Factors and
Ergonomics laboratory, [workers fare better when using adjustable
tables](http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/04/11.18.04/stand_at_work.html "standing at work")
(emphasis mine).

> upper-body discomfort, lower afternoon discomfort scores and

> Cornell and director of Cornell's Human Factors and Ergonomics
> Laboratory.

So I went on a quest to find the perfect adjustable desk. How did I
choose which desk to purchase?

*Critical hit!

by
[disoculated](http://www.flickr.com/photos/disoculated/ "Disoculated on Flickr")
from Flickr* Ok, not quite. I might have put in a little more research
into it than that.

I asked around the interwebs and received a lot of feedback on various
options. I found two desk companies that stood out:
[Ergotron](http://www.ergotron.com/) and
[GeekDesk](http://www.geekdesk.com/ "GeekDesk").

Initially, I really liked the Ergotron approach. Rather than a motorized
system for moving the desk up and down, it has a clever quick release
lever system that makes it easy to adjust the desk’s height quickly
without requiring any tools or electricity.

For this reason, I initially settled on the [Workfit-D Sit Stand
Desk](http://www.ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/PRDID/511/language/en-US/Default.aspx "Ergotron Workfit-D").
Unfortunately, Ergotron is a victim of its own success in this
particular case. They were backordered until our sun grows into a red
giant and engulfs the planet and I couldn’t wait that long.

So I ended up ordering the [GeekDesk
Max](http://www.geekdesk.com/default.asp?contentID=622 "GeekDesk Max").
This desk uses a motor to adjust to specific heights, but has four
presets. This is important because without the presets, you’re sitting
there holding the button until it reaches the height you want. While the
motor is slower than the Ergotron approach, with the presets, I can just
hit the button and go get a coffee. To be fair, it’s not all that slow.
Did I mention I’m impatient?

I’m very happy with this desk. Here’s a photo of my workspace that I
[sent to CoderWall](http://coderwall.com/p/v7xqcg "CoderWall") with the
desk in a standing configuration.

If you are looking for a more inexpensive option, I recently learned
about this [Adjustable Keyboard Podium](http://www.akp-inc.com/) that
seems like a good option. Jarrod, a StackOverflow developer, [uses it in
his
office.](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-developer-lair/)

As far as I can find, there’s only one study that points to a potential
negative health impact from standing at work.
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10901115](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10901115)

> Significant relationships were found between the amount of standing at
> work and atherosclerotic progression.

However, as you might expect, this one study is not conclusive and
doesn’t focus solely on the work habits of office workers who stand.
From what I can tell so far, the health benefits far outweigh the
detriments assuming you don’t over do it.

If you do stand at work, I highly recommend getting some sort of gel or
foam padding to stand on. Especially if you’re not wearing shoes. The
hard floor might seem fine at first because you’re a tough guy or girl,
but over the course of a day, it’ll feel like someone’s taken a bat to
your soles.

Also, vary it up throughout the day. Don’t stand all day. Take breaks
where you work sitting down and alternate.

Fight malaise!
--------------

Not every developer is the same, clearly. Some are fit, but many, well,
let’s just say that the health benefits mentioned in this post might not
factor into their decision making.

James Levine, a researcher at the Mayo clinic, had a more philosophical
point to make about sitting all day that goes beyond just the physical
health benefits. He also sees a mental health benefit.

In other words, stop sitting and write better code! Go forth and
conquer.
