When someone says they want to write a technical book, I take a hammer
and slam it on the aspiring author’s thumb and ask “How do you like
that?” If the answer is, “Very much! May I have another.” This person is
ready to write a technical book.

Sure, writing a book always starts off full of exciting possibilities.
But it soon devolves into drudgery and pain with the constant question
of whether the time spent is worth it when weighed against all your
other obligations and opportunities in life.

But no matter how much I sometimes hate the process of writing a book, I
do love this moment. The moment the fruits of your labor are delivered
in a cardboard box and you open it up to see your name on a glossy cover
with a speedy looking bobsled!

But soon after the big question sets in, “what the hell am I going to do
with all these books?!” (*I’ll bring some
to*[*MonkeySpace*](http://monkeyspace.org/ "MonkeySpace Conference")*in
October! And maybe I’ll give a few away via the internet if I can think
of a criteria for giving them out.*)

At long last, the [Wrox Professional ASP.NET MVC 4
book](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-MVC-Jon-Galloway/dp/111834846X "Professional ASP.NET MVC 4 Book on Amazon")
written by me and my esteemed coauthors, [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway"), [K. Scott
Allen](http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/ "K. Scott Allen's Blog"), and
[Brad Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson"), is
available (in
[Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009F09SRM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009F09SRM&linkCode=as2&tag=youvebeenhaac-20 "Professional ASP.NET MVC 4 Kindle Format")
and
[Print](https://www.amazon.com/dp/111834846X/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=youvebeenhaac-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=111834846X&adid=1S9J5060VMAHHP8FY145&)
formats) on Amazon.

As Jon points out [in his blog
post](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2012/09/26/professional-asp-net-mvc-4-is-out.aspx "Jon's take on the book"),
the Kindle version looks nice and is in color (on devices that support
color of course).

Real World Development
----------------------

This book includes a new chapter that I really did enjoy writing. The
focus on the chapter is building a real world ASP.NET MVC application
using the [NuGet
Gallery](http://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery "NuGet Gallery") as a case
study. The NuGet Gallery is the code behind
[http://nuget.org/](http://nuget.org/), the online public host for
thousands of NuGet packages with millions of package installs.

This is a great case study because it’s easy to [visit the
site](http://nuget.org/ "NuGet Gallery Website") while you read the
chapter and you can easily [grab the source
code](http://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery "NuGet Gallery Source Code").
The chapter covers the packages used to build the gallery as well as
some of the trade-offs the NuGet gallery team made. For example, there
are some places where we rolled our own features rather than using the
built in defaults.

Ironically, because we haven’t upgraded the NuGet Gallery yet, the
content of the chapter describes an ASP.NET MVC 3 project. But all of
the concepts and packages apply equally well to an ASP.NET MVC 4
project.

If you’re building real web applications with ASP.NET MVC, I think
you’ll find at least one thing useful in this chapter. Hopefully more!

Credits
-------

I really must give a lot of credit to my coauthors who really knocked it
out of the park. These are some smart folks I have the pleasure of
working with. Extra kudos to Jon Galloway who was more or less the
project manager and chief cheerleader in organizing the rest of us to
get this book out the door.

I also want to give a big thanks to [Eilon
Lipton](http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/ "Eilon Lipton's Blog"), our
technical reviewer. He’s the developer lead still responsible for the
developer team that works on ASP.NET MVC and Web API and is a meticulous
reviewer.

What’s Next?
------------

ASP.NET MVC 4 is the last version of ASP.NET MVC that I had any
involvement with. I don’t plan to be a coauthor on the ASP.NET MVC 5/Web
API 2 book at this point. I’m just not likely to be involved enough to
have the level of insight that I’ve had in the past. Also, it’s really
hard work.

So you should buy this book because it’ll be a collector’s item! Or, you
can take the advice of another former coauthor of mine who said [Don’t
Buy This Book
right](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/do-not-buy-this-book.html "Do not buy this book")
after we finished one together. Either way, I won’t hold it against you.
(But do buy it anyways just to spite Atwood.)

Will I write another book again? Maybe, but if I do it won’t be like any
of the books I’ve worked on in the past. I have some ideas to write a
fiction piece about a shimmery vampire wizard who goes to a school named
PigPimples under the control of a spoiled brat king named Jeffrey who
hates his midget uncle Teeryon Bannister. I even have a catchy phrase, a
Bannister always pays his dates.

If it somehow turns out that writing fiction doesn’t work out, I might
be interested in writing a book that explores more of the people aspects
of software development or related to core principles. Something that
doesn’t change and get outdated every year.

Or perhaps I’ll just keep randomly slamming keys on my keyboard and
publish the result on my blog and call it a blog post. At least I still
have fun doing that.
