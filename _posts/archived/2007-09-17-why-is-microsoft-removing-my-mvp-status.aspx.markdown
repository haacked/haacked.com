It was only two and a half months ago when I [wrote about
receiving](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/07/01/bank-error-in-my-favor.-im-a-microsoft-mvp.aspx "Bank Error In My Favor")
my Microsoft MVP award. I was quite honored to receive this award.

In [a follow-up
comment](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/07/01/bank-error-in-my-favor.-im-a-microsoft-mvp.aspx#45560 "Comment on my mvp status")
to that post, rich with unintentional foreshadowing, I mentioned the
following...

Unfortunately, I will not be retaining my MVP status long enough for the
MVP conference. I have committed an action that has forced Microsoft’s
hand in this matter and they must remove my MVP status.

To understand why this is the case, I must refer you to the [Microsoft
MVP
FAQ](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/gp/mvpfaqs "Microsoft MVP FAQ")
which states the following in the fifth question...

> **Q5:** Do MVPs represent Microsoft?
>
> **A5:** No. MVPs are not Microsoft employees, nor do they speak on
> Microsoft’s behalf. MVPs are third-party individuals who have received
> an award from Microsoft that recognizes their exceptional achievements
> in technical communities.

Starting on October 15, 2007, I will join the ranks of Microsoft as an
employee, thus putting myself in violation of this rule.

Don’t worry about me dear friend. I will cope well with this loss of
status. I don’t hold Microsoft to blame.

Well, that’s not true. I do hold them to blame. While in Redmond
recently, [Scott
Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/ "ScottGu’s Blog") (aka ScottGu)
showed me a rough prototype of a cool MVC framework they are working on
for a future version of ASP.NET. When I saw it, I told Scott,

> I want to work on that. How can I work on that?

So yes, I do blame Microsoft. I blame Microsoft for showing me something
to which I absolutely could not resist contributing. I will be starting
soon as a Senior Program Manager in the ASP.NET team.

I will continue to work from Los Angeles while we work on selling our
house, which unfortunately is bad timing as housing prices have taken a
bit of a dive around here. Once we have things settled over here, we’ll
pack our things and move up to Seattle.

I’ll be in Seattle the week of October 15 for New Employee Orientation
and to meet the rest of the team, so hopefully we can have another geek
dinner/drink (*I’m looking at
you*[*Brad*](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/ "Brad Wilson - The .NET Guy")*,*[*Scott*](http://www.lazycoder.com/weblog/ "LazyCoder")*,*[*Peli*](http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/ "Peli’s Farm")*,
et all*).

On the other side of the coin, work has been really fun lately at
[Koders](http://www.koders.com/ "Koders - Code Search Engine"),
especially with the release of Pro Edition and the rails work I’ve been
doing lately, so leaving is not easy, despite my short tenure. It’s a
great company to work for and I wish them continued success.

My last day is this Wednesday and I will be taking a short break in
between jobs to spend time with the family, travel, and get the house
ready to sell.

As for [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext"), I will continue
to contribute my spare moments leading the charge towards making it a
fantastic blogging platform. When you think about it, joining the
ASP.NET team is really just a clever ploy to make Subtext even better by
being able to influence the underlying platform in a direction that
makes it a joy to write code and tests for it. Yeah, I said *tests*. Of
course, my goal would be to make *every* app built on ASP.NET, not just
Subtext, better (and more testable as a contributing factor to being
better) due to the work that we do.

Wish me luck in that endeavor.
