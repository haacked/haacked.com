[Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WeirdTimeoutsWithCustomASPNETFormsAuthentication.aspx)
has the interesting tendency to run into the [weirdest debugging
problems](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WeirdTimeoutsWithCustomASPNETFormsAuthentication.aspx).

When I worked at Solien, I had the same talent for uncovering strange
bugs. My CTO at the time said I had the “Gift Finger” which is German
for “Poison Finger”. My blessing (or curse) was the anti-Midas touch in
software. Code that seemed to work just fine would suddenly collapse in
a flying mess of runtime errors when I took a look at it.

Fortunately, I was as good at tracking down the root causes of bugs as I
was in coaxing them out of hiding. In a similar vein, Scott describes a
harrowing account of some in depth detective work he did to track down a
particularly tricky bug. Reading his account felt like watching a good
Columbo episode. He really does give it the pacing and tension of a good
detective story.

That gave me an idea. Why not try to aggregate some great “Debugging
Detective Stories”? Scott suggested the name “CSI:ASP Debugging”. I don’
know if such a thing would warrant a published book (or a TV pilot), but
at the least, I could collect some on my blog here. So if you have a
great story of debugging a particularly nasty bug, post it in the
comments of this post or post it on your own blog and link to this one.

As for me, I don’ have any good debugging stories off the top of my head
since, as an independent contractor, I no longer have coworkers to
introduce bugs to the code. ;)

*Yes, I am kidding.*
