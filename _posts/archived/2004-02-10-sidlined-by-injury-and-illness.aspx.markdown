So I was off to a running start with my ambitious new goals of
contributing to several open source projects and creating a blog worth
reading. But as my wife so keenly pointed out, as soon as I get an inch
better, I try to take it a yard.

You see, I've been going to Occupational Therapy and will soon get some
Physical Therapy for my back and wrist problems related to RSI
(Repetitive Stress Injury). Carpal Tunnel is a form of RSI, but it is
not what I am afflicted with. I have ulnar neuritis with a dash of
tendinitis and a sprinkle of cubital tunnel syndrom (carpal's lesser
known cousin from the Bronx) thrown in.

After reading [Dare
Obasanjo's](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/SyndicationService.asmx/GetRss "Dare's Blog")
and [Scott Watermasysk's](http://scottwater.com/Blog/rss.aspx) blogs, I
was inspired to contribute to their respective open source projects. I
started out with a mad flurry of documentation writing for
[RssBandit](http://www.rssbandit.org) without taking frequent enough
breaks. I know, bad move. My back and wrists have flared up and I'm in a
bit of pain.

To add to my misery, I've caught a bad cold. Yippee Kiyay! Anyways. I'm
going to turn things down a notch, but will try to write something worth
reading every so often.
