Riiight. You know kid, you did nothing wrong, but we'd like you to give
back that gold medal anyways. We mistakenly gave it to you and we'd love
it if you corrected that mistake for us. While you're at it, I also had
an accident in the bathroom we'd like you to clean up. Thanks, now
there's a good kid.
