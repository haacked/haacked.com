This morning at 3:17 AM, Mia Yokoyama Haack was born weighing in at 7lb
8.5 oz. Now my [world domination

is complete!

is a fast little one as labor started around 11 PM and she was delivered
only four hours later!

This time around, we did a water birth at a birthing center which
involves the momma sitting in a big tub for the last part of labor and
delivery, which made for a much more comfortable experience than last
time. I think she’d definitely recommend it.

We were back home by 6:30 AM which just amazes me. Momma and Baby are
doing well. I’m still getting over my cold, but I think the adrenaline
of the whole experience helped a lot. :)
