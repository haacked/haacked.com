Here’s a little known fact about T4 Templates…well besides that they
exist in the first place. Visual Studio 2005 had support for T3
templates. T4 is the natural successor to T3. T3 is also the
abbreviation used when marketing the movie [Terminator 3: Rise of the
Machines](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181852/ "Terminator 3 on IMDB").
I heard that the names are related, but I haven’t confirmed it beyond a
doubt, which seems appropriate given the title of the movie. But you
didn’t hear that from me, deal?

Dude looks ready to write some code!

Although they’ve been around forever, I haven’t really dived into T4
templates until recently as I’ve been using them in Subtext. I’m excited
that we’re now incorporating them into [ASP.NET
MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET Website").

The Visual Web Developer Team Blog just posted an in-depth look at T4
templates in ASP.NET MVC entitled, [T4 Templates: A Quick-Start Guide
for ASP.NET MVC
Developers](http://blogs.msdn.com/webdevtools/archive/2009/01/29/t4-templates-a-quick-start-guide-for-asp-net-mvc-developers.aspx "T4 Templates Quickstart").
