as well.

Yesterday, Microsoft announced some exciting news about the formation of
the [CodePlex Foundation](http://codeplex.org/ "CodePlex Foundation")
(not to be confused with
[CodePlex.com](http://codeplex.com/ "CodePlex project hosting") project
hosting website despite the unfortunately confusing same name) whose
mission is to “***enable the exchange of code and understanding among
software companies and open source communities***”.

This is an 501(c)(6) organization completely independent of Microsoft.
For example, search the
[by-laws](http://codeplex.org/docs/Codeplex_Foundation_Bylaws.pdf "CodePlex Foundation By-Laws")
for mentions of Microsoft and you’ll find zero. Zilch.

One thing to keep in mind about this organization is that it’s very
early in its formation. There was debate on trying to hash out all the
details first and perhaps announcing the project some time further in
the future, but that sort of goes against the open source ethos. As the
main website states (emphasis mine):

> **We don't have it all figured out yet**. We know that commercial
> software developers are under-represented on open source projects. We
> know that commercial software companies face very specific challenges
> in determining how to engage with open source communities. We know
> that there are misunderstandings on both sides. Our aim is to advance
> the IT industry for both commercial software companies and open source
> communities by helping to meet these challenges.
>
> Meeting these challenges is a collaborative process. We want your
> participation.

I’m personally excited about this as I’ve been a proponent of open
source on the Microsoft stack for a long time and [have called for
Microsoft to get more involved in the
past](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/09/16/Should_Microsoft_Financially_Support_Open_Source_Projects.aspx "Should Microsoft Financially Support Open Source Projects").
I remember way back then, [Scott
Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman") suggested
Microsoft form an INETA like organization for open source as an
[editorial aside in his post on
NDoc](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SandcastleMicrosoftCTPOfAHelpCHMFileGeneratorOnTheTailsOfTheDeathOfNDoc.aspx "Sandcastle - on the tails of the death of NDoc").

### How does it benefit .NET OSS projects?

However, all is not roses just yet. If you read the mission statement
carefully, it’s a very broad statement. In fact, it’s not specific to
the Microsoft open source ecosystem, though obviously Microsoft will
benefit from the mission statement being carried out.

If you look at it from Microsoft’s perspective, there are many legal and
other challenges to participating in open source more fully. While
Microsoft has made contributions to Linux, has collaborated closely with
PHP, etc. Each time presents a unique set of challenges.

If the foundation succeeds in its mission, **I believe it will open the
doors for Microsoft to collaborate with and encourage the .NET open
source ecosystem in a more meaningful manner.**I don’t know what shape
that will take in the end, but I believe that removing roadblocks to
Microsoft’s participation is required and a great first step.

I’m honored to serve as an advisor to the board. In our first advisory
board conference call, my first question asked the question, “what does
this mean for those running open source projects on the .NET platform?”
After all, while I’m a Microsoft employee by day, I also run an open
source project at night and I have my own motivations as such.

I’m happy to see the mission statement take such a broad stance as it
seems to be focused on the greater good and not focused on Microsoft
specifically, but I am personally interested in seeing more details on
why this is good for the open source developer who runs a project on the
.NET platform. For example, can the foundation provide something more
than moral support to .NET OSS projects such as MSDN licenses or more
direct funding?

These are all interesting questions and I don’t know the answers.
Microsoft put some skin in the game by seeding the foundation with a
million dollars for the first year. The foundation, as an independent
organization, will be looking for more sponsors to also pony up money.
They will have to find the right balance in how they spend that money so
that they can continue to operate. I imagine the answer to these
questions will depend in how successful they are in finding sponsors and
operating within their budget. As an advisor, I’ll be pushing for more
clarity around this.

The full details for what the foundation will do are still being hashed
out. The interim board has 100 days to choose a more permanent board of
directors. **Now is the time to get involved if you want to help make
sure it continues in the right direction.**
