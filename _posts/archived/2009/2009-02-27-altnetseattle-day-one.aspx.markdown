Day one of the ALT.NET Seattle conference is over and I’m looking
forward to tomorrow’s sessions.

As an [Open
Spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology "Open Spaces")
event, the first order of business was for us, the attendees, to set the
session agenda for the rest of the conference. In the above photo, you
can see [Scott Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman")
proposing a topic in one of my favorite conference photos taken by [Brad
Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson"). This process took
about two hours after which many of us headed out to Red Robin for a
nerd dinner.

This is my second ALT.NET Open Spaces event and I really like the
principles set forth:

-   *Whoever comes is the right people*
-   *Whatever happens is the only thing that could have happened*
-   *Whenever it starts is the right time*
-   *When it's over, it's over*

In some ways, it reminds me of the [10 Principles of
BurningMan](http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html "10 Principles"),
specifically these two:

> **Radical Inclusion**
>
> Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the
> stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.
>
> **Participation** \
> Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We
> believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in
> society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal
> participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to
> work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through
> actions that open the heart.

There’s no hard line drawn between *attendees* and *speakers*. Everyone
is welcome to be both attendee and speaker as everyone generally has
something interesting to share, teach, and learn.

The other part I love about this conference is seeing familiar faces as
well as meeting collaborators from around the world I’ve never met in
person until now. For example, [Steve
Harman](http://stevenharman.net/ "steve harman") and I finally meet
[Simone Chiaretta](http://codeclimber.net.nz/ "Simo") in person, the
third Musketeer of Subtext, who apparently can’t keep his eyes open for
a photo after being up for over 30 hours due to flying in from Italy.

I look forward to seeing what tomorrow brings.
