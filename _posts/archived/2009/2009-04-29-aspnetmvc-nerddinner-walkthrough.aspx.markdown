[![](http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/bookcover1_6CAECF94.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470384611?ie=UTF8&tag=scoblo04-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0470384611)At
long last, the book that I worked on with [Scott
Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/ "Scott Hanselman's Blog"), [Rob
Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery's Blog"), and [Scott
Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu "Scott Guthrie's Blog") is **[in
stock at
Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470384611?ie=UTF8&tag=scoblo04-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0470384611 "Book at Amazon")**.

To commemorate the book being available, the two Scotts worked very hard
to convert the free eBook of chapter 1 (the end-to-end walkthrough) from
the PDF into [a series of HTML
articles](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/04/28/free-asp-net-mvc-nerddinner-tutorial-now-in-html.aspx "NerdDinner Tutorial").

This is a great series which walks through the construction of the
[NerdDinner website](http://nerddinner.com/). It touches upon most of
the day-to-day aspects of [ASP.NET
MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET MVC Website") that you’ll want to know.
It’s a great way to start understanding how the pieces largely fit
together.

The rest of the book is for those who want to drill deep into the
details of how the framework works. We tried to pepper the book with
notes and anecdotes from the product team in a style similar to the
annotations in the [Framework Design
Guidelines](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321545613?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321545613 "Framework Design Guidelines on Amazon.com")
book. If you’re looking for reasons *not* to buy the book, see [Rob’s
post](http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/in-which-we-discuss-writing-a-book-on-mvc/ "Writing a book on MVC").

[![extended-forehead-edition](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/ProfessionalASP.NETMVC_7E9F/extended-forehead-edition_thumb.jpg "extended-forehead-edition")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/ProfessionalASP.NETMVC_7E9F/extended-forehead-edition_2.jpg)The
bad news is that despite our heroic efforts in which we cajoled, begged,
and pleaded and rendered our clothes asunder, we were not able to
convince our editors to produce a special platinum extended forehead
edition of the book. I really thought we could we charge extra for the
limited edition cover and make gangbusters. I’ll just post it here so
you can see for yourself. Click on it for a larger view.
