After my critical post of the Mix website, I found this other site,
[http://sessions.visitmix.com/](http://sessions.visitmix.com/), which
should have been prominently linked to from the main site because it has
a working search bar and is fairly usable and flashy!

I gave two sessions on [ASP.NET
MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET Website") at Mix.

-   [ASP.NET MVC: America’s Next Top Model View Controller
    Framework](http://sessions.visitmix.com/MIX09/T50F "Next Top Model")
-   [ASP.NET MVC Ninjas on Fire Black Belt
    Tips](http://sessions.visitmix.com/MIX09/T44F "Ninjas on Fire")

As you can see, we tried to have a bit of fun with the session titles.
If you’re not tired of hearing me talk about MVC, you can also [see an
interview](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/ASPNET-MVC-1-with-Phil-Haack/ "ASP.NET MVC RTM Continuum")
I did with Adam Kinney on Channel 9.

I will be posting my demos on my blog sometime soon hopefully. I want to
give a few of them the full blog treatment. Partly because all of my
demos are built live and I don’t keep the final product around, so I
need to redo the steps. And I’m lazy. There. I said it.
