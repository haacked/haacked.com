UPDATE: I updated this post slightly to address some good [criticsm from
Rob
Mensching](http://robmensching.com/blog/posts/2009/3/6/More-on-Haacks-Troubleshooting-Windows-MSI-Installers "More on Haack's Troubleshooting")
by removing the MsiZap section. Note that this post does not blame the
Windows Installer for the few problems we have with ASP.NET MVC
installations. The major culprit tends to be either `devenv /setup` or
`ngen.exe`.

The point in this post is to provide tools for those who are very
careful, know what they are doing, and really want to take a peek at how
the installer works. These tools can help provide insight to whether the
two culprits I just mentioned really are the issue causing the
installation to fail in your particular case. Everything I point out
here IS AT YOUR OWN RISK! :)

For the most part, the installations for ASP.NET MVC have been quite
stable and we’ve tested the installer at every release and 99% of the
problems we’ve run into fall into those two buckets. I did not intend to
give the impression that we saved installation testing for the last
moment, because that’s just not true. We merely had a [last minute
requirement
change](https://haacked.com/archive/2009/03/03/aspnetmvc-changes-for-rc2.aspx "Changes for RC 2")
for our installer. RC 2 was a response to that change, not to a bug
found. Now back to the post. :)

Having an installer crap out on you when you’re excited to try out a new
piece of software is an incredibly frustrating experience. Frustrating
both for the user as well as for the product team. Every time I read on
Twitter that someone is having trouble installing [ASP.NET
MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET Website"), a new ulcer throbs in my
side.

A big part of the frustration is the lack of control and insight into
what’s going wrong. Jacques (no blog), a developer on the ASP.NET team
has put together a troubleshooting guide based on his research into what
makes installers tick to help alleviate some of this lack of control.
While his focus was primarily on the ASP.NET MVC installer, much of this
information is useful for all MSI installers.

Windows Installer Log Files
---------------------------

Log files are not automatically generated by an MSI. To generate a log
file, you will need to use `msiexec` from a command prompt to install
the MSI, for example

> `msiexec /i AspNetMVC1-RC2.msi /l*v .\install.log`

Alternatively you can enable logging by default by configuring a
registry key for this. See [this article on enabling Windows Installer
Logging](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/223300 "How to enable Windows Installer Logging")
or if you are using Windows XP, take a look at this [article on the same
topic specific to Windows
XP](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314852 "How to Enable Windows Installer Logging in Windows XP").
Please note that enabling this feature can have an impact on system
performance.

The MSI logs are probably the best place to start when trying to figure
out why an installation failed. At the very least you will be able to
identify the step in the installer that caused the problem.

For example, one common source of trouble is when a required service is
not started such as:

-   .NET Optimization Service
-   ASP.Net State Service

Visual Studio Log Files
-----------------------

The ASP.NET MVC specific context menus in Visual Studio are installed by
executing `devenv.exe` with the `/setup` switch. When the installer
executes this command it automatically generates a log file at the
location

> `%TEMP%\ MvcTemplates.log`

The log file can be consulted for more details in case this step of the
installation failed.

Orca
----

Orca is an editor for Windows install packages (MSI files) and is part
of the [Windows Installer
SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=6A35AC14-2626-4846-BB51-DDCE49D6FFB6&displaylang=en "Windows Installer SDK")
(the Orca MSI is located at %Program Files%\\Microsoft
SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0A\\bin). While we don’t generally encourage people to
edit the ASP.NET MVC installer, for those willing to take matters into
their own hands (at your own risk!) Orca can be used to disable some of
the steps executed by the installer. When you open the MSI you will see
all the tables used by the installer. The feature table is probably the
most interesting since it shows everything that will be installed.

[![clip\_image002](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TroubleshootingInstallations_1283F/clip_image002_thumb.jpg "clip_image002")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TroubleshootingInstallations_1283F/clip_image002_2.jpg)

Notice that by default, the Level attribute of all the features are set
to 1. This means that the feature is enabled to be installed. We have
some logic that will disable some of the features based on the
information that we gather about the system on which were are
installing. For example, the *VWDExpress\_Feature* will be disabled if a
user does not have Visual Web Developer installed. Similarly we will
disable one of the *MvcGacNgenXX\_Features* depending on whether the
underlying OS is a 64-bit or 32-bit version.

Let’s say that you’ve tried to install MVC, but for some reason the
installer fails to create a native image for `System.Web.Mvc.dll` using
*NGEN*. Using Orca you can disable the *MvcGACNgen32\_Feature* and
*MvcGACNgenAll\_Feature* by deleting these two rows from the MSI and
saving it under a different name. Of course the best thing to do is to
investigate why NGEN is failing in the first place.

**Editing the MSI is not really encouraged since it may cause other
problems such as failing to uninstall properly.**

NGEN failures
-------------

We automatically *GAC* and *NGEN* `System.Web.Mvc.dll` during the setup
process. Installing into the *GAC* (Global Assembly Cache) is a
relatively painless operation. *NGEN* on the other hand is more prone to
causing the installer to fail.

When installing via double clicknig the MSI, you will see an error
message before the installation is rolled back if NGEN fails. The error
message itself is not that useful as it will most likely just show a
cryptic message and an HRESULT value (You can do a web search for the
HRESULT and see whether there are workarounds available). To investigate
the failure, take a look at the log generated by the MSI (assuming you
had logging turned on when you made the install). Open the log file and
search for ExecNetFx (this is the name of the WiX component the
installer uses to run NGEN).

    ExecNetFx:  Microsoft (R) CLR Native Image Generator 
      - Version 2.0.50727.3053
    ExecNetFx:  Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.
    ExecNetFx:  Installing assembly System.Web.Mvc, Version=1.0.0.0, 
      Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31BF3856AD364E35
    ExecNetFx:  Catastrophic failure (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8000FFFF 
      (E_UNEXPECTED))
    ExecNetFx:  Error 0x8007006d: failed to allocate output string
    ExecNetFx:  Error 0xffffffff: Command line returned an error.
    ExecNetFx:  Error 0xffffffff: failed to execute Ngen command: 
      C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\ngen.exe install 
      "System.Web.Mvc, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, 
      PublicKeyToken=31BF3856AD364E35"

The example above is a very difficult problem to troubleshoot, but there
are a few things you can try:

-   Open a command prompt, go to
    **`%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727`** and execute the
    following commands and then try to install MVC again
    -   **ngen ExecuteQueuedItems**
    -   **ngen Update**

-   Examine the NGEN log files located in
    **`%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727`**. There are two
    files, ngen.log and ngen\_service.log. The logs may contain
    information about other problems in the system that caused the
    failure, for example a missing DLL that may cause an update
    operation to fail when NGEN attempts to update invalid native
    images.
-   Make sure that the .NET Runtime Optimization service is running
    ![clip\_image004](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TroubleshootingInstallations_1283F/clip_image004_3.jpg "clip_image004")

Windows Event Viewer
--------------------

The installer executes a number of external tasks during the
installation process.

-   devenv.exe /installvstemplates: This step is used to register the
    MVC project templates in Visual Studio. (For Visual Web Developer
    the executable is called VWDExpress.exe).
-   devenv.exe /setup: This step is executed to merge all the metadata
    in Visual Studio and is used by the MVC packages to register the
    context menus.
-   ngen.exe install: Used to generate native images of the
    System.Web.Mvc assembly. See
    [this](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163610.aspx)
    article for more details.
-   ngen.exe update: Updates any native images that have become invalid.

You will most likely see multiple warning events such as the example
below. Visual Studio will log warning events for unknown attributes it
encounters in templates and usually just moves past them. These warnings
can be safely ignored.

[![clip\_image006](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TroubleshootingInstallations_1283F/clip_image006_thumb.jpg "clip_image006")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TroubleshootingInstallations_1283F/clip_image006_2.jpg)

But you may see other events that may cause the install to fail such as
the example below:

[![clip\_image008](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TroubleshootingInstallations_1283F/clip_image008_thumb.jpg "clip_image008")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TroubleshootingInstallations_1283F/clip_image008_2.jpg)

Solving this problem is easy enough; restart the Cryptographic Service
and run the installer again.

Visual Web Developer Express
----------------------------

A few users have reported that after installing MVC, they don’t see an
option to create an MVC Web Application Project in Visual Web Developer.
If you run into this problem, try the following:

-   Open VWD.
-   Go to Tools and select Import and Export Settings.
-   Select Reset all settings and click Next to complete the wizard.

Third Party Utilities
---------------------

A number of users have reported problems during the installation of MVC
or when trying to use some of the shortcuts inside Visual Studio. In
many cases this was resolved by removing certain add-ins:

-   PowerCommands
-   Clone Detective
-   Spec\# and F\#

If you review the MSI logs you will most likely see something like the
following:

    MSI (s) (5C:70) [13:27:26:106]: Executing op: CustomActionSchedule(Action=VisualStudio_VSSetup_Command,ActionType=3122,Source=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe,Target=/setup,)

    MSI (s) (5C:70) [13:28:41:075]: Note: 1: 1722 2: VisualStudio_VSSetup_Command 3: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe 4: /setup 
    Error 1722. There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor. Action VisualStudio_VSSetup_Command, location: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe, command: /setup 

    MSI (s) (5C:70) [13:28:42:716]: Product: Microsoft ASP.NET MVC RC 2 -- Error 1722. There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor. Action VisualStudio_VSSetup_Command, location: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe, command: /setup

If installing MVC fails in this manner, try the following:

-   Create a log file, for example, devenv.log.
-   Open a Visual Studio command prompt and execute devenv /setup /log
    devenv.log. Make sure that you have administrator rights since
    that’s required by the /setup switch.
-   Scan the log file and look for any \<description\> elements that
    contain errors. This may point to problematic packages that are
    causing devenv.exe to fail when MVC is trying to configure its
    context menus.

Another option to try is the following:

-   Open a Visual Studio command prompt.
-   Start Visual Studio by executing the command devenv /ResetSkipPkgs.
-   Close Visual Studio.
-   Execute devenv /setup.
