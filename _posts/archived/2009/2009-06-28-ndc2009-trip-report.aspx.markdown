When you visit Norway, it takes a week to recover. Ok, at least when *I*
visit Norway, it takes a week. But that’s just a testament to the good
time I had. As they say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but what
happens in Oslo gets [recorded as a .NET Rocks Live
episode](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=458 ".NET Rocks Live with Hanselman and Haack").

The week before last, I spent the week in Oslo, Norway attending and
speaking at the [Norwegian Developer’s
Conference](http://www.ndc2009.no/en/ "NDC 2009") (NDC 09). This
conference was not your typical Microsoft conference I usually attend
but was a conference on .NET with a heavy Agile Software bent.

Just looking at the [speaker
line-up](http://www.ndc2009.no/en/index.aspx?cat=1070 "Speaker Lineup")
will tell you that. [Scott
Bellware](http://blog.scottbellware.com/ "Scott Bellware's Blog") [tweeted
a
blurb](http://twitter.com/bellware/status/2332327295 "Bellware on Twitter")
recently that succinctly summarized my impression of the conference:

> how to know you're at a good conference: the speakers are going to
> sessions (at least the ones who aren't working on their sessions)

That is definitely true. I didn’t attend as many talks as I would have
liked, but I did manage to attend two by [Mary
Poppendieck](http://www.poppendieck.com/ "Mary Poppendieck") which
really sparked my imagination and got me excited about the concept of a
problem solving organization and learning more about Lean. She had
promised to put her slides on her site, but I can’t for the life of me
find them! ;)

While there, I gave three talks, one of them being a joint talk with the
[Hanselnator](http://hanselman.com/ "Scott Hanselman's Blog") (aka Mr.
Hanselman).

> **Black Belt Ninja Tips [ASP.NET
> MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET Website")**
> This covered several tips on getting more out of ASP.NET MVC and
> included the first public demonstration of [David Ebbo’s T4
> template](http://blogs.msdn.com/davidebb/archive/2009/06/17/a-new-and-improved-asp-net-mvc-t4-template.aspx).
>
> **ASP.NET MVC + AJAX = meant for each other
> **This covered the Ajax helpers included with ASP.NET MVC and drilled
> into some of the lesser known client aspects of these helpers, such as
> showing the `Sys.Mvc.AjaxContext` object and how to leverage it. The
> talk then moved into a demonstration of the client templating feature
> of [ASP.NET Ajax 4 Preview
> 4](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=24645 "Preview 4 of Ajax 4").
> I showed off some of the work [Jonathan
> Carter](http://lostintangent.com/ "Jonathan Carter's Blog") and I
> (mostly Jonathan) did to make two-way data binding work with ASP.NET
> MVC. The audience really dug it.
>
> **The Haacked and Hanselman Show
> **So named because we didn’t have any agenda until about a week before
> the conference, this ended up being a web security talk where Scott
> would present a common “secure” implementation of a feature, I would
> then proceed to “Haack” the feature, and then Scott would fix the
> feature, all the while explaining what was going on. I think this was
> very big hit as we saw messages on Twitter like “I’m now too afraid to
> build a web application”. ;) Of course, I hope more attendees felt
> empowered rather than fearful. :P

conference was held in an indoor soccer stadium since it was a venue
large enough for all the attendees. They curtained off sections of the
bleachers to create rooms for giving the talks. On the outside of the
curtains was a large screen which allowed attendees to walk around from
talk to talk with a headset on the conference floor if they didn’t feel
like sitting in the bleachers.

[![IMG\_3455](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NDC09TripReport_12378/IMG_3455_thumb.jpg "IMG_3455")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NDC09TripReport_12378/IMG_3455.jpg)Plenty
of bean bags on the floor provided a comfortable place to relax and
listen in. In fact, that’s where I would often find some of my new
friends lounging around such as the [crazy
Irishman](http://certsandprogs.blogspot.com/ "Niall Merrigan").

On the second night of the conference, we all rocked out at the big
attendee party featuring the band,
[DataRock](http://www.datarockmusic.com/ "DataRock") which played some
rocking music with geek friendly lyrics like:

> I ran into her on computer camp
> (Was that in 84?)
> Not sure
> I had my commodore 64
> Had to score
>
> *-- DataRock, Computer Camp Love*

[![data-rock](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NDC09TripReport_12378/data-rock_thumb.jpg "data-rock")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NDC09TripReport_12378/data-rock_2.jpg)Many
thanks to [Kjetil Klaussen for posting those lyrics in his NDC 09
highlights
post](http://www.kjetilk.com/2009/06/ndc-2009-highlights.html "NDC 2009 Highlights")
because I had forgotten pretty much every lyric. :) After DataRock, we
all went upstairs for the after party to enjoy a more intimate setting
with LoveShack, an 80s cover band.

One interesting highlight of the show was a live recording of .NET
Rocks. The show was originally going to simply feature Scott Hanselman,
but while hanging out in the speakers lounge Carl Franklin, one of the
hosts of the show, suggested I join in the fun too.

[![haack-hanselman-dotnetrocks](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NDC09TripReport_12378/haack-hanselman-dotnetrocks_thumb.jpg "haack-hanselman-dotnetrocks")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NDC09TripReport_12378/haack-hanselman-dotnetrocks_2.jpg)While
it was great fun, Scott is a big, no ginormous, personality and I rarely
got a word in edgewise, except for the few times I swooped right in just
in time to put my foot in my mouth to apparently great comedic effect.
In any case, you can [listen to the
results](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=458 ".NET Rocks Show #458")
yourself, though I hope they post the video soon to get the full effect
of how much fun everyone was having. :) Be warned, there’s not a lot of
real software development content in the show.

The conference ended on Friday leaving all of Saturday for me to relax
and actually get out and see Oslo. On Saturday, I headed out to
[Vigeland Statue
Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigeland_Park "Vigeland Statue Park")
with an eclectic group of people, [Ted
Neward](http://blogs.tedneward.com/ "Ted Neward"), [Rocky
Lhotka](http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/ "Rocky") and his wife, [Jeremy
Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/ "Jeremy Miller"), and
Anna K{Something With Too Many Syllables in a Row}, a conference
organizer herself.

The park was very beautiful and I took a ton of pictures, but
unfortunately I lost my camera on the flight home from Norway. :( So
instead, I’ll just include this Creative Commons licensed picture taken
by [Cebete from
Flickr.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cebete/2614928119/ "Cebete") The
main difference was the sky was a deep blue when we visited.

[![Vigeland-Park](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NDC09TripReport_12378/Vigeland-Park_thumb.jpg "Vigeland-Park")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NDC09TripReport_12378/Vigeland-Park_2.jpg)That
evening, Sondre Bjellås, an attendee, was kind enough to invite several
of us over to his flat for a little gathering. I headed over with
Bellware and Anna since everyone else was pretty much flattened by the
previous weeks activities. It was great to meet non-techie Norwegians
such as his wife and friends in order to get a different perspective on
what it’s like to live in Norway. The answer: **expensive!**

In an odd coincidence, on my connecting flight in Philadelphia, I ran
into my good friend Walter who happened to be flying home from Belgium.
In fact, we were on the same flight in the same exit row with seats
right next to each other. How’s that for a funny coincidence?

### Show me the Code!

Rune, one of the organizers of the conference, assures me that the
videos of the talks will be posted online soon, so you’ll get to see
them if you’d like. I’ve also posted my [powerpoint slides and code
samples
here](https://haacked.com/code/NDC09-Demos.zip "Powerpoint Slides").

Please note that my talks tend to be heavy in demos so the Powerpoint
decks don’t have much content in them. Likewise, the code samples
represent the “before” state of my talks, not the “after” state. I
usually write up a checklist for each talk which I use a to remind
myself where I am in those cases where I have a total brain fart and
forget my own name under the pressure of presenting.
