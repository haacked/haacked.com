A member of the Subtext team discovered a security vulnerability due to
our integration with the FCKEditor control as well as the FreeTextBox
control. This vulnerability would potentially allow unauthenticated
users to upload files using the file upload tools included with these
editors.

### The Fix

**If you’re running the latest version of Subtext (Subtext 2.1.1)**, the
quickest way to patch your installation is to copy the following
web.config file…

```csharp
<configuration>
    <system.web>
        <authorization>
            <allow roles="Admins" />
            <deny roles="HostAdmins"/>
            <deny users="*" />
        </authorization>
    </system.web>
</configuration>
```

…to the following directories within the Providers\\BlogEntryEditor\\
directory.

-   FCKeditor\\editor\\filemanager\\browser\\default\\connectors\\aspx\\
-   FCKeditor\\editor\\filemanager\\upload\\aspx\\
-   FTB\\

**If you’re running an older version** or would rather not have to hunt
through your installation, upgrade to **[Subtext
2.1.2](http://subtext.googlecode.com/files/SubText-2.1.2.2.zip "Subtext 2.1.2")**.
The only difference between this version and 2.1.1 is the change
mentioned above.

### Notes

This is the second time [we’ve been
bitten](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/20/urgent-subtext-security-patch.aspx "Urgent Subtext Security Patch")
by integration issues with these rich text editors. The Subtext team
takes security very seriously and regret that this vulnerability was
released. We’ll take a hard look at these integration points and may
consider turning them off by default or some other mitigations. I have a
feeling that most of our users use Windows Live Writer or some other
such application to post to their blog anyways.

You might wonder why we don’t simply include that web.config file within
the *Providers* directory. I tested that out and unfortunately it breaks
FCKEditor for no good reason that I could deduce.

Again, I feel terrible that this happened and we’ll work hard to ensure
it doesn’t again. My thanks goes to Si Philp who found the issue and
discreetly reported it.
