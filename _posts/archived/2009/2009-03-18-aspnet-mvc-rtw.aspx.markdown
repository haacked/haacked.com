Today I’m happy to write that ASP.NET MVC 1.0 RTW (Release To Web) is
[**now officially
released**](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=144444 "ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Download Details Page").

This was one of several announcements
[ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) made at the Mix 09 conference
today, which I unfortunately missed because I was on a plane to Vegas
enroute to Mix 09. I was busy  back at the mother ship making sure
everything was in order for the release.

Woohoo!

It’s been nearly a year and a half since I [joined
Microsoft](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/17/why-is-microsoft-removing-my-mvp-status.aspx "Joining Microsoft")
and started working on it and what a ride it’s been.

Some highlights during that time:

-   We [shipped our unit
    tests](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/04/17/asp.net-mvc-preview-of-a-preview.aspx "Preview of a preview")
    using a third party OSS mock framework on CodePlex.
-   We [bundled
    jQuery](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/09/30/jquery-and-asp.net-mvc.aspx "jQuery and ASP.NET MVC"),
    a third party OSS JavaScript framework, with ASP.NET MVC itself.
-   I gave my [first PDC
    talk](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/ "My first PDC talk")
    covering the basics of ASP.NET MVC.
-   We shipped the RTM!

With ASP.NET MVC, we wanted to release early and often providing a lot
of transparency with our design process. We made a lot of changes based
on user feedback. All in all, I counted **10 releases**:

1.  [December 2007
    CTP](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-3-5-extensions-ctp-preview-released.aspx "ScottGu announces December CTP")
2.  [Preview

A great way to learn about ASP.NET MVC is to go to the website,
[http://asp.net/mvc/](http://asp.net/mvc/ "ASP.NET MVC"). Also be sure
to check out the [free eBook which contains Chapter 1 of Professional
ASP.NET
MVC](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/03/10/free-asp-net-mvc-ebook-tutorial.aspx "Free eBook").
This chapter contains an end-to-end walkthrough of building an
application with ASP.NET MVC.

We also have an updated **[set of documents on MSDN worth checking
out](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145989 "MSDN Docs about ASP.NET MVC")**.

A great way to install ASP.NET MVC is via the [new Web Platform
Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/web "Web Platform Installer"). I
highly recommend it. Not only can you install ASP.NET MVC using it, but
many other free applications such as one of my favorites,
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext")!
