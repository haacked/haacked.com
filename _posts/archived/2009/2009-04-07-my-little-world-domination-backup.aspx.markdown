Every good developer knows to always have a backup. For example, over
two years ago, I announced my [world domination
plans](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/05/World_Domination_Phase_1_Commenced.aspx "World Domination Plans").
But there was a single point of failure in me putting all my world
domination plans on the tiny shoulders of just one progeny. My boy needs
a partner in crime.

So my wife and I conspired together and we’re happy to announce that
baby #2 is on the way. Together, the two of them will be unstoppable!

My wife is past her first trimester and we expect the baby to RTF
(Release To Family) around October.

This second time around has been a bit more challenging. My poor wife,
bless her heart, has had to deal with much more sever nausea this time
around.

Notice the crinkle in the ultrasound photo. My son did that. ;) He's
trying to destroy the evidence.

Many of you who have more than one children might be able to relate to
this, but I really considered not writing a blog announcement for my
second child. There was the *feeling* that it was such a novel thing the
first time, but now it’s becoming old hat (not really!).

But then I mentally fast forwarded 16 years later and pictured my future
daughter finding the firstborn announcement and not finding her own blog
announcement. Try explaining *that* to a kid. I can deal without the
drama.

Well I won’t have to! Hi honey, here’s your announcement. Now you be
good while daddy goes shopping for a shotgun and a shovel. :)
