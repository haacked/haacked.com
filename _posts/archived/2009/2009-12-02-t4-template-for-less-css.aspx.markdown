Good news! I have contributed my T4 template to the .less project. You
can access it from the big download button [on their
homepage](http://www.dotlesscss.org/ "dot less project homepage").

Pain is often a great motivator for invention, unless you become dull to
the pain. I think CSS is one of those cases where there’s a lot of pain
that we as web developers often take in stride.

Fortunately not everyone accepts that pain and efforts such as
[LESS](http://lesscss.org/ "LESS") are born. As the home page states:

> LESS extends CSS with: variables, mixins, operations and nested rules.
>
> Best of all, LESS uses existing CSS syntax. This means you can rename
> your current .css files .less and they’ll just work.

LESS solves a lot of the pain of duplication when writing CSS.
Originally written as a Ruby gem, [Christopher
Owen](http://enginechris.wordpress.com/ "Christopher Owen's Blog"),
[Erik van Brakel](http://blog.smoothfriction.nl/ "Erik's Blog") and
[Daniel Hoelbing](http://www.tigraine.at/ "Daniel's Blog") ported a
version to .NET [not surprisingly called
.less](http://www.dotlesscss.org/ ".less Beta"). Here are some examples
from the .less homepage:

.Less implements LESS as an `HttpHandler` you add to your website mapped
to the .less extension. I think this is a great approach when combined
with the proper cache headers in the response.

However, sometimes I just want to have static CSS files. So I decided to
write a T4 template for .less. Simply drop it in a folder that contains
.less files and it will generate a .css file for each .less file.

Not only that, I also added a setting to then minimize the CSS using the
[YUI Compressor for
.NET](http://www.codeplex.com/YUICompressor "YUI Compressor for .NET").
This allows you to write your CSS using clear readable .LESS syntax, but
deploy minified CSS. To turn off minification just edit the T4 file to
change the value of the `_minified` variable.

Usage is very easy. The following screenshot shows a folder containing a
.less file, one for each sample on the .LESS homepage. Notice that I
don’t actually reference the YUI compression nor .LESS libraries. I just
added them to a solution folder so you could see them (and so the T4
template can find them).

With this in place, I can simply drop my T4CSS.tt file into the Css
directory and voila!

You can see the converted CSS files by expanding the T4CSS.tt node in
the solution explorer as shown in the screenshot above.

In order to produce multiple output files, I used the approach that
Damien Guard did in his post, [Multiple outputs from T4 made easy –
revisited](http://damieng.com/blog/2009/11/06/multiple-outputs-from-t4-made-easy-revisited "Multiple outputs from T4 made easy - revisited").
Basically I just embedded his T4 in mine.

You’ll notice there’s an extra file, T4CSS.log, that’s generated.
Unfortunately using Damien’s approach, it’s not possible to suppress the
default file generated by the T4 template, so I used that to log the
operations.

Also note that at the time of this writing, there’s a bug in .LESS that
causes one of the samples to throw an exception. I reported it to the
developers so hopefully that gets fixed soon.

Lastly, there have been T4 changes in Visual Studio 2010. I didn’t try
this template with VS10 yet. When importing the assemblies, you may need
to either add them to the GAC or reference them with a full path. When I
get some time I’ll play around with that to see how to get it to work.

I have contributed this T4 template to the .less project. You can access
it from the big download button [on their
homepage](http://www.dotlesscss.org/ "dot less project homepage").
