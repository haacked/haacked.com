I finally have my registration worked out and I’m officially going to
Mix09 this year! Woohoo! Not only am I going, but I’ll be speaking at
Mix for the first time, so be sure to come by and say hi.

I’ve mentioned this before, but Mix is easily one of my favorite
Microsoft conferences. [Jeff
Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror") said it well:

> **MIX is by far my favorite Microsoft conference** after attending the
> ’06 and ’07 iterations...
>
> What I love about Mix is that it ...
>
> -   is relatively small and intimate, at around 2,000 attendees.
> -   seamlessly merges software engineering and design.
> -   includes a lot of non-Microsoft folks, even those that are
>     traditionally hostile to Microsoft, so there’s plenty of
>     perspective.

I’ve been to every one so far:

-   [Mix
    06](https://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/16/ReadyToMixItUp.aspx "Mix 06")
    The first one ever where Atwood,
    [Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway"), and I
    tore things up.
-   [Mix
    07](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/02/mix07-pics-from-mix.aspx "Mix 07")
    The one where I met
    [Miguel](http://tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel de Icaza"), saw the
    genesis of Moonlight, and decided I wanted to join Microsoft.
-   [Mix
    08](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/03/08/back-from-mix-back-to-reality.aspx "Mix 08")
    The first to have a talk on [ASP.NET
    MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET Website") given by [Scott
    Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman").
-   Mix 09 We’ll see…

I’ll be giving the following two sessions at Mix this year:

> MIX09-T50F **ASP.NET MVC: America's Next Top Model View Controller
> Framework**
>
> See how to build a simple application that highlights some of the key
> capabilities of ASP.NET MVC. Also, learn how to improve productivity
> using some of the cool new tooling features
>
> MIX09-T44F **Microsoft ASP.NET Model View Controller (MVC): Ninja on
> Fire Black Belt Tips**
>
> See a walkthrough of several tips and tricks for getting the most out
> of the ASP.NET MVC framework.

The first talk is an introductory overview and the second one allows me
to dig in a bit more.

I’ve been working hard on putting together some demos so I will
hopefully have something interesting to show off. In any case, if you’re
going to the conference, leave a comment and when you’re there, be sure
to come by and say hello.

Also, let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to cover.
This should be a fun one.
