Just wanted to wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, or a
Happy whatever you are celebrating at this time of year. I hope you are
spending it well with family and friends! :)

As you can see, I’m still hard at work watching the kids on paternity
leave.

My brother is a drug dealer and the name of the drug is [Call of Duty:
Modern Warfare
2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267S2A0?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00267S2A0 "Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 at Amazon.com")
for the X-Box 360. I’m totally hooked right now, and I don’t usually get
so hooked on games.

At least I am managing to still get some fresh air outside and enjoy the
weather. Here I’m walking with my wife (taking the photo), my mother, my
son, and my brother.

Of course, every walk we go on ends up with me lugging my son around.

I wouldn’t trade it for anything. :)
