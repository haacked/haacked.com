You’ve spent hours setting up your blog on your favorite blog platform
just right. Good for you! **So how do you maintain your blog so that it
remains at the top of its game?**

It turns out, there are a large number of free web utilities useful for
improving your blog’s effectiveness outside of your blog engine.

Everytime I come across one of these useful utilities, I bookmark it to
my *Blog Utilities* folder. **This folder is my blogger utility belt,
full of tools to meet every need when composing blog posts or optimizing
my site for bandwidth and speed**.

I’ve chosen to focus on web utilities as they are quick and easy to use
— no installation required. This is not a comprehensive list by far, as
I am sure there are many others out there. Let me know what I missed in
the comments.

### Optimization

The first three tools in this category are all website speed testers,
but each offers something different, so I’ve listed them all.

1.  **[Web Page
    Analyzer](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/ "Web Page Analyzer")**
    - This tool is fairly comprehensive and may be the only one you
    really need for website speed analysis. Includes stats on every file
    and object downloaded and provides approximate download times for
    different connection rates.
2.  **[OctaGate Site
    Timer](http://www.octagate.com/service/SiteTimer/ "OctaGate Site Timer")**
    - I didn’t find this one to be as accurate as the first one because
    it attempted to download images referenced in my CSS files that were
    commented out. However, it provides a nicer graphical output that
    marks when the request was started, when it connected, and the time
    when the first and last bytes were received. It also highlights 404
    errors in red, which is handy for finding missing files or bad URLs.
3.  **[HttpZip Compression
    Checker](http://www.port80software.com/products/httpzip/compresscheck "Port80 HttpZip Compression Checker")**
    - Use this to check whether files from your website are being served
    with HTTP Compression on or off. Thanks to [Jeff
    Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/blog/ "CodingHorror blog") for
    pointing me to this one (among others).
4.  [**Dynamic Drive Online Image
    Optimizer**](http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/imageoptimizer/ "Image Optimizer")**-**if
    you’re hardcore about your image compression, you should check out
    [**Ken Silverman’s Utility
    Page**](http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm#pngout "Ken Silverman’s Utility Page").
    But if you’re like me and just want a quick and easy web based
    utility for compressing images, this is your site. It can convert
    gif, jpg, and png files up to 300kb. It will also do conversions to
    other image types and display multiple results at various color
    levels and compression rates so you can pick the best one for your
    needs.
5.  **[Javascript
    Minimizer](http://fmarcia.info/jsmin/test.html "Javascript Minimizer")**
    - This is an extremely simple tool. Paste in your javascript and
    click the button and reduce the size of your javascripts.
6.  **[CSS
    Minimizer](http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/main/csscompressor/ "CSS Minimizer")**
    - Just like the Javascript minimizer, but for Cascading Style
    Sheets.

### Statistics and Search Engine Optimization

Get a handle on your web traffic with these sites.

1.  **[Website Grader](http://www.websitegrader.com/ "Website Grader")**
    - Gives your website a score in an attempt measure its
    *effectiveness*. Shows your PageRank, meta info, domain info,
    technoratic stats, etc... It generates a really neat report card for
    your blog.
2.  **[Google Webmaster
    Central](http://www.google.com/webmasters/ "Google Webmaster")** -
    An absolute essential tool for those who care about users finding
    their site via Google. Especially pay attention to the **[Webmaster
    tools](http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/ "Webmaster Tools")**
    which include Sitemap support.
3.  [**Google
    Analytics**](http://www.google.com/analytics/ "Google Analytics")**-**A
    free and full featured analytics package for your blog or website.
    Add some javascript to your page template and you’re in information
    overload land, but done up with nice charts and graphs.
4.  [**103bees Search traffic
    analysis**](http://103bees.com/ "Search traffic analysis")****-
    Unlike other stats packages, this one is focused purely on natural
    search engine traffic analytics. What are users searching for when
    they land on your site? This is a nice complement to Google
    Analytics. And it’s free! One caveat is that the script can be slow
    sometimes, which can play havoc with CSS based designs.
5.  **[Technorati](http://technorati.com/ "Technorati")** - It’s so
    obvious, I almost forgot to list it. Register, claim your blog, and
    find out who is linking to you. You can add a little script to your
    blog that displays how many other posts link to yours.
6.  [**Alexa.com**](http://alexa.com/ "Alexa web stats") - The beauty of
    this site is that you can easily [compare your website’s
    reach](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=haacked.com/&site1=codinghorror.com&site2=&site3=&site4=&y=r&z=1&h=300&w=500&range=6m&size=Medium&url=http://haacked.com/ "Compare Reach")
    with several other websites on a single graph, thus starting a huge
    pissing contest.

### Spicing Up Your Posts With Images

1.  **[Wikipedia Public Domain Image
    Resources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Public_domain_image_resources "Public Domain Images")**
    - Images can bring a blog post to life. But rather than worrying
    about receiving a cease and desist letter for misusing copyrighted
    material, why not use images that are part of the Public Domain?
    This page is chock full of links to resources for free images.
2.  **[PicFindr](http://www.picfindr.com/bin/PicFindr3.html "PicFindr")
    -**Despite it’s “Oh so Web 2.0” name (must everything end in a
    consonant plus “*r*” these days? At least it doesn’t have *BETA*
    anywhere), this tool is really great. It will search a set of free
    photo sites such as
    [**Stock.xchng**](http://www.sxc.hu/ "Stock Exchange"), for free
    photographs.
3.  **[Flickr Creative
    Commons](http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/ "Flickr Creative Commons")**
    - Still haven’t found that picture that just hits the point you’re
    trying to make? Try the Flickr Creative Commons search engine.
    Remember, these photos are not public domain. You do need to abide
    by the license. But for the most part, the licenses are pretty
    lenient for you to reuse the photos in your own blog.
4.  **[Open Clip Art Library](http://www.openclipart.org/ "Clip Art")**
    - Maybe you want your image to be *iconic*rather than
    *photographic*. Check out this free Public Domain clip art library
    to find an icon for every occasion.
5.  **[WP
    Clipart](http://www.wpclipart.com/index.html "Public Domain Clip Art Library")**
    - Another Public Domain clip art library, though the quality tends
    to be less than the Open Clip Art Library.

### Create and Improve Your Content

1.  **[Cliche Finder](http://cliche.theinfo.org/ "Cliche Finder")** -
    Try to avoid using too many tired old cliches by running your post
    through this web based utility.
2.  **[HallwayTesting.com](http://www.hallwaytesting.com/ "Hallway Testing")**
    - This is a fantastic site for basic hallway usability testing. Just
    submit your URL and real people will post comments with criticisms
    and praise for your site. The more specific you are about what you
    want testers to focus on, the better quality the feedback. Try it
    out.

### Syndication

1.  **[FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com/ "FeedBurner")** - This one
    gets special mention because it fits in so many categories. It’ll
    help optimize your bandwidth by serving your RSS feeds for you.
    Also, it includes a basic free stats package as well as a premium
    stats package that can replace Google Analytics. FeedBurner can also
    provide features your blogging platform might not, such as
    subscribing to RSS Feeds via email.

### Special Mention

As I mentioned before, this post is focusing on web utilities. However,
these two utilities are so essential, I just had to break my own rule
and list them.

1.  [**Firebug Firefox
    Add-on**](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/ "Firebug") - Ok,
    this breaks my rule as it isn’t technically a website, but it is a
    FireFox browser plugin so it might as well be a website, right? Well
    in any case, this tool is too important not to mention. It has it
    all. It can be used to time your websites download speeds, view the
    underlying HTTP information, measure the size of each file. Add to
    that a great Javascript debugger and CSS and DOM explorer. This is a
    must have tool.
2.  [**Windows Live
    Writer**](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/ "Windows Live Writer")
    - I broke my rule again. This tool won’t help you write better
    content, but it’ll help you have fun doing it. Also, all the plugins
    available make it easy to add a little extra oomph to your blog
    posts by including Flickr images, formatted code, etc...

Again, I’m sure I missed someone’s favorite tool hear, so please let me
know what I missed in the comments. And if you do, let me know which
tool you’d remove from this list in order to add yours. I’ll try
following up at a later time with an improved list.
