*Download the [MSI and Release notes
here](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=16775 "ASP.NET CodePlex Preview 5").*

Last night we released ASP.NET CodePlex Preview 5 on CodePlex. Be on the
lookout for one of those famous epic blog posts from
[ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu "Scott Guthrie") describing the
release. In the meanwhile, the release notes contain short write-ups of
what has changed.

We didn’t originally plan to have another preview. However, we
implemented a few significant chunks of functionality and were dying to
get feedback so that we could incorporate it into the product before
Beta. It helps that with five or so of these interim releases, we’ve
become pretty efficient producing these releases.

We plan to have our next release be our official
[Beta](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/08/15/understanding-beta.aspx "understanding beta"),
which means we’ll have a lot more test passes to produce and run before
we release the next one.

In the meanwhile, take the code for a test drive and let us know what
you think. Some of the naming needs to be cleaned up, so you can expect
some name changes and improvements to the API from here to Beta, along
with a lot of bug fixes and a few more features. Naming classes is
tough, so we appreciate good suggestions there. :)

One change that I think I forgot to mention in the release notes is that
the Ajax helpers do not accept inline script any longer, they take
method names. Those helpers are all in their own namespace now as
extension methods which allow you to completely swap them out with ones
of your own.

If you’re interested in more details about how our action method
selection works, be sure to read my post entitled [How a Method Becomes
an
Action](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/08/29/how-a-method-becomes-an-action.aspx "How a Method Becomes An Action").
Be sure to keep an eye on [Brad Wilson’s
blog](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson") too, as he put in
some work on this feature and will describe the view engine changes.

UPDATE: Brad just blogged about [partial rendering and view
engines](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/08/partial-renderi.html "Partial Rendering and View Engines")
in ASP.NET MVC.
