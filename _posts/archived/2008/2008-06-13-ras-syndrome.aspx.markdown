Yesterday, I [wrote a
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/06/12/ironruby-and-asp.net-bffs-forever.aspx "IronRuby and ASP.NET")
that contained the phrase “BFFs Forever” in the title. Commenters were
quick to point out the redundancy of “Forever” in the title.

> Nice - BTW, your title is redundant, so your title reads “IronRuby and
> ASP.NET Best Friends Forever Forever”

Thanks! But I had made the very same point in that post.

Case in point, how often do you hear the phrase “PIN Number” which
expands to “Personal Identification Number Number”. I started looking
for other examples of such redundant acronyms and sure enough, there’s a
term for them and a [wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome "RAS Syndrome on Wikipedia")
describing them.

And in case you didn’t notice, “RAS Syndrome” is itself humorously a
RAS. The Wikipedia article points to other great examples.

-   ATM machine
-   HIV virus
-   ISBN number
-   CSS style sheets
-   Please RSVP
-   CNN Network

The article references another page with a [collection of more redundant
acronyms](http://www.nanday.com/rap/ "RAS collection").

-   LAN network
-   DAT tape
-   RF frequency
-   UPC code

It’s not surprising that most of these come from the technology field as
we tend to be very acronym happy and love our TLAs (Three Letter
Acronyms).

So now it is my turn to coin a RAS. I am going to call it PCS syndrome
which stands for “Premature Correction Syndrome syndrome.” This
describes the condition in one is compelled to interject with a
correction without having read through the rest of the contents,
especially when the author offers an explanation for the seemingly
erroneous item. ;)

I’m only teasing because PCS happens to me a lot. I find that the
comments to many of my blog posts tend to focus on some irrelevant
miniscule detail rather than the topic at hand. Which I’m not
necessarily opposed to because that provides great fodder for future
blog posts!
