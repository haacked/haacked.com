You don’t so much *return* from Las Vegas as you *recover* from Las
Vegas.

Right now, I am recovering from my Las Vegas trip. Recovering from
*Vegas Nose* caused by the extremely dry air and massive second hand
smoke inhalation. Recovering from the sensory onslaught they call
*casinos*. Recovering from the fake kitschiness and manafactured
excitement as people sit like zombies feeding machines their life
savings.

Yet despite all that, I still love the place. Maybe because despite the
bad things, Vegas is really the Disneyland for adults with a slight bad
streak inside that yearns to get out once in a while to indugle in a
vice or three.

I especially love the Mix conference there. As Jeff [Atwood
writes](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001068.html "See you at Mix")
(and I agree)...

Some highlights from Mix include seeing old friends again such as
[Jon](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway"),
[Steve](http://stevenharman.net/ "Steve Harman"), and
[Miguel](http://www.tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel de Icaza"). Also enjoyed
having time to hang with my coworkers in a non work setting after having
imbibed much alcohol. And of course meeting a lot of people I know
through the intarweb such as [Kevin
Dente](http://weblogs.asp.net/kdente/ "Kevin Dente"), [Steven
Smith](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/ "Steven Smith"), and [Dave
Laribee](http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/ "Laribee") among
others I’m forgetting at the moment.

I also played Poker for the first time at a casino and I had a blast,
leaving with some winnings despite losing four close showdowns, a couple
of them in which my pocket Kings were beaten by pocket Aces. Who’d a
thunk it?!

The past couple of weeks have been a rough time for me and my family. I
missed a few days of work due to a bad fever, and my wife then suffered
through the same fever the following week. Fortunately Cody hasn’t
seemed to have caught the fever.

In a week, we will finally move into our new home. While our temporary
housing has been nice, we’ve been here a long while and it’s just hard
to feel settled when we are not in our own home. Once we move into our
house and make it our own, I think we’ll finally feel settled into this
place and find our rhythm here. Who knows, maybe I’ll have more time for
my extracurricular activities I used to do.

Speaking of extracurricular, I have joined two soccer leagues now, the
GSSL (Greater Seattle Soccer League) and the MSSL (Microsoft Soccer
League). Unfortunately, my foot is injured due to a hard tackle so I
didn’t have a good showing in my first MSSL game today.

In the past month, I’ve given several talks, some that went well and one
that went...how should I put it...very badly. Hopefully I will be asked
to speak again. At least my TechReady (an internal talk) went well with
240 attendees, but probably because [Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman") carried the
both of us. ;) That boy can talk!

If you’ve read this far expecting technical content, my apologies, it’s
a Saturday. We just had an updated preview of MVC released and I will be
writing about that in some upcoming posts. In the meanwhile, the sun
just came up outside for once and my mood is lifted after a dark few
weeks. Things are starting to look up for me in this town. Hope things
are well with you as well.
