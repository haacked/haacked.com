Whew! I’ve finally found a bit of time to write about my impressions of
the PDC 2008 conference. If you’re looking for insightful commentary and
a “What does this all mean” post, you’ve come to the wrong place. There
are plenty of
[others](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/11/01/Thoughts+Of+A+PDC+2008+Gone+By.aspx "Thoughts of a PDC")
providing [that
sort](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081101-the-week-in-microsoft-pdc-pdc-and-pdc.html)
of
[commentary](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/ "Never underestimate Microsoft's ability to turn a corner").
I’ll just string together some random impressions and pics from my
perspective.

First of all, one thing I’m very impressed with is that all sessions are
viewable online almost immediately afterwards, with full video of the
slides and the presenter. Now I understand why they asked me not to pace
too much. To see my presentation, [visit its Channel9
Page](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/ "ASP.NET MVC Talk"). **Note
that my slides and sample code are now up there**.

I hade a great time delivering this talk (see photo of the room before I
started above) and as I wrote before, I uncovered [a new presentation
tip](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/10/28/hot-new-presentation-tip.aspx "Hot new presentation tip").

There were 1150 attendees at the talk. If you saw my talk, be sure to

as the last time I checked, only 95 people did.

course the best part of the conference (besides excessive amounts of
RockBand) is hanging out with the people! I spent time at the ASP.NET
lounge at various points in the conference answering a boatload of
questions about ASP.NET MVC. This has inspired a nice backlog of posts I
should write.

I also spent a lot of time in the Open Spaces area enjoying the geekout
sessions. Especially Dustin Campbell’s session on currying, closures,
etc… which turned into a discussion of functional languages as I was
showing up.

course, the various parties were great too. I don’t have pictures of the
Universal Studios trip, unfortunately, but I will say the Simpson’s ride
was awesome. I only brought my camera to the Dev After Dark party, on
Wednesday night, which is where most of these are from.

As you can see here, Jeff Atwood, Miguel De Icaza, and myself having a
good time at the JLounge. We tried to get it renamed to NLounge, but to
no avail.

One of the highlights of the evening was running into my coworker’s
hero, The Dude from The Big Lebowski holding a white russian!

Ok, it’s actually [Ted Neward](http://blogs.tedneward.com/ "Ted Neward")
graciously posing with my drink as this was probably the 2048^th^ time
he heard this joke.

[![OG-microsoft](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/PDC2008RecoveryProgram_D759/OG-microsoft_thumb.jpg "OG-microsoft")](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/PDC2008RecoveryProgram_D759/OG-microsoft.jpg)
And wouldn’t you know it, but the Microsofties from the early days
showed up to the party. There’s young Bill in the lower left corner.

It was very interesting to meet so many people in person who I’ve “met”
before via comments in our forums, on my blog, Twitter, etc…

Especially in the cases where a person in the past reported a bug in a
forum, and then at PDC had the opportunity to explain it to me so that
we both understood the issue more clearly. In any case, I’m hopefully
done travelling for the year.
