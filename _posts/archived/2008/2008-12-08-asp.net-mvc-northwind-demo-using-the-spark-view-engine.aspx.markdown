While at PDC, I met [Louis
DeJardin](http://whereslou.com/ "Where's Lou") and we had some lively
discussions on various topics around ASP.NET MVC. He kept bugging me
about some view engine called Flint? No… Electricity? No…
[Spark](http://dev.dejardin.org/ "Spark View Engine")!

I had heard of it, but never got around to actually playing with it
until after the conference. And the verdict is, I really like it.

Spark is a view engine for both Monorail and [ASP.NET
MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET MVC Website"). It supports multiple
content area layouts much like master pages, which is one thing that
seems to be lacking in many other view engines I’ve seen, which only
support a single content area, correct me if I’m wrong. Not only that,
but he’s already included
[IronPython](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython "IronPython on CodePlex")
and [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net/ "IronRuby") support.

But what I really like about it is the simple way you effectively data
bind HTML elements to code. Let’s start with a simple example. Suppose
you have an enumeration of products you’re passing to the view from your
controller action. Here’s how you might render it in Spark.

```csharp
<viewdata model="IEnumerable[[Product]]"/>

<ul class="products">
  <li each="var product in ViewData.Model">${product.ProductName}</li>
</ul>
```

Note the each attribute of the `<li>` tag contains a code expression.
This will repeat the `<li>` tag once per product. The `<viewdata>`
element there declares the type of the `ViewData.Model` property.

Spark still supports using code nuggets \<% %\> when you absolutely need
them. For example, when using the `BeginForm` method, I needed a using
block, so I used the code nuggets.

Just for fun, I redid the views of my Northwind sample to replace all
the ASPX views with Spark as a demonstartion of using an alternative
view engine. **[Try it

UPDATE: Updated to the latest version of ASP.NET MVC and Spark as of
ASP.NET MVC 1.0 RC 2.
