My compadre [Scott Hunter](http://blogs.msdn.com/scothu/ "Scott Hunter's Blog"), another PM
on the ASP.NET team, who happens to work on the Dynamic Data feature,
recently put together an example of using ASP.NET MVC and Dynamic Data
Web Forms together in the same application. Look for the link to
MvcDynamicData.zip on this [Code Gallery
page](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicdata/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=994 "Download Sample").

I’ve been working on a post detailing a couple different ways to
integrate WebForms and MVC, but life has been really busy for me lately.
Hopefully I’ll get that to you soon.

the meanwhile, you can probably learn all you need to know by looking at
this example.

By the way, Scott was recently [featured on .NET Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=349 "Scott Hunter on Microsoft Dynamic Data").
We need to get a better picture of him taken. That whole Smoking Man image has got to go.
