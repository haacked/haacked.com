I had a bit of a rough start to my first Tech-Ed Hong Kong last week.
Pretty much every day while [I was in
Japan](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/10/12/japan-trip-2008.aspx "Japan Trip 2008"),
I dutifully pulled out the laptop (despite my lack of internet
connection) and made sure it still worked fine.

Things seemed to be looking up when I got a free business class upgrade
on the way to Hong Kong from Tokyo for giving up my seat. It meant
taking a longer flight, but I had a really enjoyable flight. But while
waiting in the airport lounge, I decided to take advantage of the free
Wi-Fi there, but couldn’t get my computer screen to display anything.
Hoping it was some weird hibernation issue, I put my laptop away and
decided to wait till I was in HK.

Sure enough, the screen still didn’t work. Fortunately, I follow [rule
\#1 of the Joel
Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html "The Joel Test")
for all my presentations and keep it all in source control using a
private instance of Subversion. A member of Microsoft Hong Kong kindly
lent me his laptop (thank you!) and I got it into more-or-less working
order, as you can see from this shot of the room just before I began my
first talk on ASP.NET MVC.

Even so, working on an unfamiliar laptop is still a pain and there were
a few hitches in demos where I wasn’t sure how to change various display
modes quickly on the laptop.

Since my talks were [all in the
morning](https://haacked.com/archive/2008/09/15/tech-ed-2008-hk.aspx "Speaking Schedule"),
it gave me time to travel around a bit.

I took a tram up to Victoria Peak to get an eye catching panoramic view
of the city, though the day I chose to go was not as beautiful as the
next two days.

On the first night, there was a little Microsoft get-together for MVPs
and employees at Cenna Bar and Lounge. The entrance to the place is
practically hidden via a non-descript doorway on this street. You walk
in, and take the lift up to the 23rd floor and suddenly you’re in this
small but hip little bar.

Seems like a lot of cool places are hidden away up high in these
buildings.

I really enjoyed the opportunity to have some great conversations with
various Chinese people, as many of the attendees were from mainland
China. In our conversations I realized that certain stereotypes we tend
to have over in the U.S. are completely not valid. In principle, I know
this is usually the case, but it often takes engaging in very
interesting conversations for that to really hit home.

Afterwards, a small group of us went shopping. There is no sales tax on
most items in Hong Kong, so it’s a popular place for Chinese shoppers. I
merely tagged along for the experience.

The next day I did some more sight-seeing around the city, taking a Star
Ferry across to Kowloon and then walking around the Central and Wan-Chai
districts afterwards.

On the last evening, I met up with an old friend from college from Hong
Kong for a night on the town in which we mixed and mingled with the
local denizens.

Notice that Microsoft’s LINQ technology is so popular that there’s a bar
named after it. I believe another bar called “to SQL” was just around
the corner.

As a strategy to beat jet lag, I ended up staying out all night until it
was time to catch a cab to the airport, stopping at my hotel room to
quickly grab my things. I’ll let you know tomorrow if it worked.
