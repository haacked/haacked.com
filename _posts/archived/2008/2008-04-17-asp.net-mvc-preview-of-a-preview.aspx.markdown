UPDATE: Just to prove that this is a preview of a preview, we had a
signing problem with the initial pre-built VSI download. If you tried
building from source, everything should’ve been ok. We apologize for
that. Even though this is meant to be a rough preview, we do want to
have a high quality bar in that you should be able to try out the code.
So if you run into that problem, please do download the VSI again.

It’s no secret that Microsoft can get better at naming **non RTM**
(Release to Manufacturing) releases. We have terms like CTP, Preview,
Alpha, Beta, RC (Release Candidate), and so on. On the other hand, at
least Microsoft does try to move things along to RTM rather than keeping
products in perpetual Beta.

With ASP.NET MVC, we also need to add yet another type of release. For
now I’ve been calling this a *[CodePlex Source
Release](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=12640 "CodePlex Source Release")*
meaning it’s simply sharing source code that is *in progress*.
[ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/ "Scott Guthrie") called it a
“Preview of a Preview” in my office one day and that name stuck with me.
This is really a preview of an upcoming preview. ;)

Speaking of ScottGu, he posted [a detailed description of this
release](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/04/16/asp-net-mvc-source-refresh-preview.aspx "ASP.NET MVC Source Refresh Preview")
on his blog last night. I recommend taking a look at it because he
covers most of the changes in good detail.

One aspect of this latest source release that I’m particularly happy
about is that we released our unit tests. As Scott mentioned, we are
using [MoQ](http://code.google.com/p/moq/ "Moq") as a mock framework
within our tests. Note that this is not some official endorsement of any
particular mock framework. Originally we started out trying to port our
tests to Rhino Mocks (which I’ve [written a lot
about](https://haacked.com/tags/rhino+mocks/default.aspx "Rhino Mocks on Haacked.com")).
MoQ just happened to have a programming model that was closer to the way
our internal mock framework works, so we switched over to MoQ.

I will write more about this release later. But for now, I will leave
you with an **[updated Northwind
Demo](https://haacked.com/code/NorthwindDemo.zip "Northwind")** based on
this release because *there ain’t no party like a Northwind party*.
