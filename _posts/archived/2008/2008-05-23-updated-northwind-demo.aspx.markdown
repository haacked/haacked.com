I updated the template to have the correct assembly references so it
should work now out of the box. Sorry about that.

while ago Scott Hanselman linked to my [Northwind
sample](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETMVCCheesyNorthwindSampleCode.aspx "cheesy northwind sample")
which itself was spawned from an initial sample that [Brad
Abrams](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/ "Brad Abrams") wrote.

As I like to say (*to anyone who will listen*)

So I went and updated my sample to work well with the recently released
ASP.NET MVC ~~Preview 3~~Beta.
