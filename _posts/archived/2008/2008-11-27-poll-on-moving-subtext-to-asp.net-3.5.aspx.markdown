How many of you out there who use Subtext host it on a hosting provider
who does not have ASP.NET 3.5 available? I’d like to make the next
version of Subtext 2 take a dependency on 3.5. Note that it wouldn’t
have to take a dependency on SP1. Just ASP.NET 3.5 proper as I believe
most hosting providers support it.

If you’re stuck with a hosting provider who only supports ASP.NET 2.0
and not 3.5, do leave a comment.

Note that we’re still in the planning stages for Subtext 3, which will
be built on ASP.NET MVC. In the meantime, I still plan to update Subtext
2.\*. In fact, much of the work we will do for Subtext 3 may be
prototyped in 2.\* and ported over.
