![](/assets/images/TheBigHit.jpg "The Big Hit") In the 1998 movie, [The Big
Hit](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120609/), the protagonists kidnap the
daughter of an extremely wealthy Japanese businessman. When they call to
deliver the ransom notice, they turn to Gump who employs a brand name
Trace Buster to prevent police from tracing the call.

Unbeknownst to Gump, the father has a Trace-Buster-Buster at his
disposal. This in turn triggers Gump to use his
Trace-Buster-Buster-Buster in an ever escalating battle to evade
detection.

I just love that scene.

But I'm not here to talk about movies. I've recently noticed a post or
[two](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001407.html)
critical of the practice of blogging about blogging i.e. Metablogging.

I couldn't help but to think of the Trace-Buster-Buster-Buster... The
irony of dismissing blogging about blogging is that in doing so, you're
blogging about blogging about blogging. And in highlighting this, I'm
blogging about blogging about blogging about ... well you get the
picture. I've become a Meta-Meta-Meta-Meta blogger.

Not that I'm taking sides here. If you find blogging about blogging
boring, so be it. It is quite easy to avoid it. But I doubt it will
simply die off. Unless of course blogging itself dies off.

I recently walked through the hallowed shelves of the local Borders book
store in Santa Monica with my wife and noticed an entire shelf of books
on writing. The thought that we might see the end of writing about
writing never occured to me.
