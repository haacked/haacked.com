UPDATE Wow, check out the [privacy

[announced](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/05/time-waits-for-no-one.html)
on its blog that they've release a beta version of their new web
accelerator designed for broadband use. I'll give it a shot and see how

Man, these guys are pushing out a lot of interesting products. My screen
