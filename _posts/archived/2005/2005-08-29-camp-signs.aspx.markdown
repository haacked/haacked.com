If you’re heading off to Burning Man this year and want to swing by and
say hi (and have a drink), we’re staying in Hysteria (the outermost
ring) between 8:00 and 8:30. Our camp will be clearly marked with these
camp identifiers.

Today I’m in San Jose staying with my friend Kyle ready to get a bit of
work done. Tomorrow bright and early we’re heading off to the BRC.
