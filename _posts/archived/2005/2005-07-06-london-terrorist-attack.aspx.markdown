![London Blast](https://haacked.com/assets/images/LondonBlast.jpg) By now you
must have heard that there was a [Terrorist attack in
London](http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/07/07/london.tube/index.html)
in which at least 33 are dead and many more injured.

There are a lot of photos coming into Flickr. Take a look at the “Hot
Tags” in the last 24 hours such as
[blasts](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/blasts/),
[bombs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/bombs/) and
[london](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/london/) to see pictures from
the ground.

My thoughts and well wishes go out to those in London, especially to
those affected, their families and their friends.
