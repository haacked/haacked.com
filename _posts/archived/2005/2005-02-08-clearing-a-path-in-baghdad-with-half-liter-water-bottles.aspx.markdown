In his latest
[entry](http://serjak.blogspot.com/2005/02/nothing-happening_09.html)
about life as a infrastructure reconstruction project manager in
Baghdad, Mr. Serjak describes the security detail that drives him to an
onsite location. One detail in particular struck me as funny.

I seriously need to get a rack mount of water bottles for my car. That
would come in quite handy for the L.A. free way. Can you see me chucking
an Evian at grandma ahead of me for driving too slowly in the fast lane?
