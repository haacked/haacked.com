Chris Sells humorously relates his experience dealing with his traffic
violations.

If you think the Oregon police sound strict, try dealing with the
Military Police. I once was ticketed by an MP on an Air Force base while
riding a 10 speed! He claimed I entered the intersection too fast, but
from my view, I had waited till all the cars had passed and then entered
the intersection.

When I saw the tell-tale red and blue lights behind me, I considered
gunning it for a moment, but my legs were tired and I wasn't ready for a
Dukes of Hazard moment.

I don't remember a monetary fine, but my dad did have to go talk to his
first officer as a result. He tells me it was rather non-eventful, but I
like to think it went something like this:

**1st officer:** So Sgt Haack, I see your son got himself in a bit of
trouble.\
**Dad:** Yes sir, a minor traffic violation.\
**1st officer:** I didn't realize he was old enough to drive.\
**Dad:** Well sir, he isn't.\
**1st officer:** ah, so driving without a license too. Sounds like a bad
start.\
**Dad:** Possibly, though he was riding a bicycle. But you know kids
these days. It starts with riding a bicycle too fast and the next thing
you know, he's smoking crack.\
**1st officer:** Ummm. I see. Well tell your son to keep it in a lower
gear. Dismissed.
