After reading Martin's post and his reasoning for contacting Bloglines,
it sounds like much ado over nothing. In my humble opinion, he's making
a myopic mistake in action and reasoning.

First of all, if he's going to provide an RSS feed for his blog, his
argument against Bloglines is disingenous. His RSS feed is stripped of
his contact info and branding as well.

I have a simple solution for him, simply put your contact info at the
head or tail of every blog post. Problem solved! You can now take a step
forward instead of a step back. If you're trying to get your promotional
information out there, why make it harder for others to receive and
consume. Especially given the popularity of bloglines. It just seems so
short sighted to me. Then again, never underestimate the power of
controversy to get you noticed.

Here's an example of how to do a tagline:
