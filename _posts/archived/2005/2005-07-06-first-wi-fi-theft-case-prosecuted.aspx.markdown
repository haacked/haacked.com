[Walt

the [first reported case of prosecution for Wi-Fi
theft](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=562&e=1&u=/ap/techbits_wi_fi_theft).

I agree with Walter when he says that...

Although sorry Walt, I’m not quite buying your alternative argument
about “squatter rights” or “adverse possession”. A Wi-Fi network doesn’t
suffer quite the scarcity as land (it’s orders of magnitude easier to
create a new network than it is to create land).

Besides, no matter how long someone has been leeching off an unencrypted
network, I feel the owner of the network always has to right to switch
on encryption at any time. In a manner, it is similar to identity theft.
I don’t care how long a thief has been using a victim’s identity, that
thief should never have squatter’s rights or the right to attempt
adverse possession on the identity.
