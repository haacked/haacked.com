![Music Video Screenshot](/assets/images/CoolVideo.jpg) This is quite possibly
one of the [coolest music videos
ever](http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/deliverMedia.asp?id=34205f2d-a938-4d18-908e-31671813fb84&delivery=stream).

p.s. anyone know how to take a screenshot of a video in windows media
player?

UPDATE: Well as you can see I can take screenshots now thanks to [Jon
Galloway's](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway) suggestion to use
[Fraps](http://www.fraps.com/). Sweeet.
