As I recently said, you have to be [a bit
MacGuyver](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/12/16/11350.aspx) to be a
successful consultant. I’ve also whined about [how difficult hiring
is](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/12/16/11351.aspx), especially when
you want to hire MacGuyver. But then there are times where you work with
someone who makes MacGuyver look positively clueless.

Jon for example takes the gum wrapper (to really beat an analogy to a
sickening death) and [shows us how to upload a lot of custom data to
MapPoint](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2005/12/18/433432.aspx?Pending=true)
given its constraints. Now this is a sweet example of problem solving.

Just for the record, I let Jon have the interesting work while I futzed
around with [these stupid textbox
labels](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/12/12/11330.aspx).
