I once said he missed the [point with Farhenheit
9/11](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/06/30/711.aspx) and he linked to
my criticism (bringing with it a lot of traffic). I appreciated and
respected that he could see my post as an attack on his position and not
a personal attack.

So for your 50th, I'll [link back as you
requested](http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/01#aBirthdayRequest),
though I can't promise I'll bring much traffic in return.

And by the way, Dave, have you seen [The
Corporation](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/04/29/2888.aspx) and if so,
what are your thoughts?
