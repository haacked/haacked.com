Just got back from the PDC Underground at the Westin Bonaventure which
had its fair share of great and not so great grok talks. I went with
Micah and [Jon](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/) and met a few people
I’ve only been acquainted with via subscribing to their blogs.

One is [Jeff Key](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/) who is a heck of a funny
guy. Also met [Stuart Celarier](http://cs.ferncrk.com/blogs/stuart/) who
had a long day overseeing the BOFs and didn’t arrive at the Westin till
past midnight.

Also making a quick appearance was [Don
Box](http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/default.aspx) sporting a
shirt with “WTF?”. I thought he was pimping [The Daily
WTF](http://thedailywtf.com/) but he informed me that it stood for
Windows Transaction Framework. WTF?

Of course I ran into the ever friendly and communal [Adam
Kinney](http://www.adamkinney.com).
