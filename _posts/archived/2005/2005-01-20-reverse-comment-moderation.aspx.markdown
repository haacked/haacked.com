One [complaint](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/20/1944.aspx#1964)
about rel="nofollow" is that you just might want to reward people who
post related and constructive links in the comments section of your
blog.

My answer to that is to implement reverse comment moderation. As far as
I'm concerned, I'd like comments to appear immediately on my site.
However, I don't want them getting Google juice. Call me vindictive if
you will. I know it won't stop comment spam. But I do think it's a fine
complement to other methods that do attempt to stop Spam

Instead, I'd be happy to go in and remove rel="nofollow" for all links
within a post. Ideally there'd be a really nice interface for it. A
simple checklist of the day or week's comments and I could check them
off and post it.

Then again, I don't really care that much. If you really post a comment
with something worthwhile, I'll just mention it in my next blog entry
sprinkling a tiny bit of Google juice on your link. (And I do mean tiny.
I'm part of that [long
tail](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html) Chris Anderson
talks about).
