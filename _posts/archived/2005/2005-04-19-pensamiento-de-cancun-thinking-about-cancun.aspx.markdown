Planning a vacation is proving to be a
challenge now that I'm independent. Last year, Akumi and I decided that
we were going to England for two weeks this April. Well April has come
and is about to go, and we're no closer to Jolly old England (and Old
Trafford).

With my project ramping up, I just don't think we can do two weeks of
vacation in a row. Of course, this isn't really fair to my wife as I'm
still [going to Burning
Man](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/02/02/2075.aspx) at the end of
August. We need a shorter vacation for the two of us, so I thought of
our good neighbors next door. Mexico!

Having surveyed her Mexican expatriate coworkers, my wife reported that
they unanimously declare Cancun as the place to go. Armed with that
information, we nearly jumped on an all-inclusive deal that would have
us flying out of Los Angeles this Saturday. But good sense (or something
resembling it) took hold and we stopped ourselves (for the moment).

I'm skeptical of all-inclusive deals because of the simple fact that
once they have you there, they don't have much incentive to step up the
quality of food. Imagine travelling all the way to Mexico for bad
Mexican food. ¡Aye Carumba!

So now we're looking at November as a good time to enjoy the turquoise
beaches of Cancun and Tulum. However, if you've been there and had a
great time (or not), I'd love to hear about it. ¡Muchas Gracias!
