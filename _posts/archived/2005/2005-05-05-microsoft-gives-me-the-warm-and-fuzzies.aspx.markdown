[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) has posted [Steve Ballmer's
email](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=65966#65966) on
public policy engagement and outlines the thought process [behind the
reversal](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/06/3040.aspx).

After reading the email, I just have to say, much props and kudos to you
Steve and Microsoft! One of the key points Steve makes is...

> After looking at the question from all sides, Ive concluded that

It highlights that social responsibility is good for business.

This devotion to diversity, frankly, is heartwarming and uplifting. As a
"mixbreed", I'm all over diversity. The more colors the better (although
that doesn't always apply to web design people). Reading Ballmer's email
made me feel that Microsoft might actually be a great place to work. And
that's a good thing for Microsoft. To be seen as a progressive workplace
will invite the best and the brightest. As will shipping timely solid
software. One down and one to go.
