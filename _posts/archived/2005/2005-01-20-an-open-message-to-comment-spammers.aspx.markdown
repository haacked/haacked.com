![Monkey](/assets/images/MonkeyJoel.jpg)Hello y'all. In case you haven't
noticed, links in my comments now have a rel="nofollow" attribute
attached. That means no more Google juice when you post a list of links
in the comments section of my site. So you can stop now. No really. Move
along. No point in comment spamming here.

Ok, since you're still here, you've apparently noticed, this hasn't
placed a magical barrier around comment spamming. You've forced me to
unveil my next weapon against comment spam. When posting a comment, my
server will obtain your IP address and location and unleash a legion of
angry lonely Ninjas to dispatch anyone found at the address. Not to
mention that my server will start streaming Yanni's greatest hits to
your browser. If you make me really angry, I'll send Yanni himself. But
only in rare occasions as his hourly rate burns a hole in my wallet.

Besides, your comments will be removed from my site expediently. I have
a crack team of monkeys in Nigeria who are highly trained to identify
and remove comment spam from my site. For one banana a month, comment
spam is cleansed from my site. (Sorry to American monkeys for
offshoring, but I really couldn't afford the standard five banana rate).
