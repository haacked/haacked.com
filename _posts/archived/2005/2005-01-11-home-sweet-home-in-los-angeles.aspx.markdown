We have perfect timining. We arrived in Los Angeles this morning to
beautiful blue skies. Rumor has it that it's been raining for the past
four days or so, but I don't believe it.

It's nice to be home after a wonderful vacation. We picked up Twiggy
from the doggy day care and are now fighting the effects of jet lag. I
am also struggling with my new addiction, NeverWinter Nights Platinum
edition. As if I don't have enough on my plate with RSS Bandit Dev,
Contracts, Book Proposal Reviewing, and general reading. Oh yeah, and my
day job.
