So you’re ready to bore the world with your stuttering lisp via
podcasting. Congratulations! Join the thousands of others podcasting
their mind numbing undifferentiated message.

But there is a way to stand out. You need an **audio logo**. Audio logos
arguably have a stronger impact than visual logos. Think of the
following companies: NBC, Intel and 20th Century Fox. Can you hear in
your head their audio logos? Now that’s impact!

Michael Whalen, an independent film score composer, recently started a
[podcasting logo division](http://podcastinglogos.com/), geared towards
the more limited budgets of the typical podcasting outfit.

So when the time comes for me to unleash my nasally atonal discordant
voice upon the world, it’s heartening to know that my drivel could be
accompanied by a kick ass audio logo from someone who’s done work for
ABC News, PBS, Apple Computers, etc...
