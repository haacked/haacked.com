For some reason, I've always wanted to write a book. It started off as a
desire to write the next *Lord of the Rings* classic, but has morphed
into writing a reasonably useful technical book.

So after reading Mike Gunderloy's 8 part "[Advice for
Writers](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/AdviceforWritersPart1.html)"
and Eric Gunnerson's post "[So You Want to Write a Computer
Book](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/articles/396328.aspx)", I've come to
the conclusion that it might be better for me to start off with a few
print articles.

Ultimately I'd love to contribute an article to Wired (the best damn
magazine on Earth...and beyond), but for now, I'm looking at various
.NET technical journals and magazines. If you have experience writing
for a magazine and have recommendations on publishers who were great to
work with, please let me know.
