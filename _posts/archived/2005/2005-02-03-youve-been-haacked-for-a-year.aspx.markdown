I've kept a couple of other blogs before, but this is my first with
staying power. My blog new year resolutions include being even more
irreverent, geeky, rash, and misguided (if even possible). It's been one
year, and I recently passed the 500 post mark without even noticing (I
hate missing an opportunity to party).

If you're a regular reader (hi Mom, Dad, Wife), do you realize that
there's much better drivel out there? But you probably read this blog
for the same reason I read yours, you're trying to expunge some latent
guilt by self flagellation (Ignore the fact that the phrase "self
flagellation" is redundant.). I hope that works out for you.

Seriously though, I've been surprised by the quality of comments I
receive on my postings. I may have a few readers, but they're smart
readers \*cough\* \*suckup\* \*cough\*. Except for those who find this
site by Google and are not searching for a technical topic. Them are the
dumbest f\*\*\*s I've ever seen.

Well stick around, I have an exciting line-up of topics coming up. They
actually involve a bit of work \*damn!\*, so they'll be out less
frequently. But they will be above poor. I'll probably try to blatantly
start a controversy or two to drum up traffic so that people will click
on my ads (oops, I'm not supposed to promote the ads, there's
controversy \#1) and this blog can pay for itself. And you can be sure
I'll continue to be one [vain
motherblogger](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/08/1322.aspx).
