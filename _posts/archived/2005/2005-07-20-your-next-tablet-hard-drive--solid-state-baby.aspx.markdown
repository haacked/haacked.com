![Samsung SSD](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SamsungSolidState.jpg) Too bad
[these things aren’t out
yet](http://www.samsung.com/PressCenter/PressRelease/PressRelease.asp?seq=20050523_0000123980#).
With no moving parts, this thing sips power, less than 5% of the power
consumption of current hard disk drives, while blazing at 150 percent of
the performance of comparably sized drives.

The downside is that these will start off much smaller than your typical
hard-drive and the first ones won’t be available until August. I need a
new drive before Tuesday when we leave for Japan.
