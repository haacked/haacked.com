Welcome to the new pissing contest.

According [to this
site](http://www.business-opportunities.biz/projects/how-much-is-your-blog-worth/),
my blog is worth...

![](https://static.flickr.com/23/25822676_789bf55448_t.jpg)\
 My [blog](haacked.com) is worth **\$92,020.02**.\

Ok, I’m ready to sell out! ;)

UPDATE:
[Others](http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/archive/2005/10/24/4134.aspx)
[around](http://www.mattberther.com/2005/10/000682.html) the
[block](http://www.scottcreynolds.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=73369149-8e05-488d-be10-9c9053d1fce7)
have been posting their blog’s worth.

Of course, as [Scott Reynolds points
out](http://www.scottcreynolds.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=73369149-8e05-488d-be10-9c9053d1fce7),

Which is actually encouraging because I can probably find some fool
willing to part with twice the figure listed above for my blog. But I
better sell fast before the bubble bursts and blogs go through a huge
market slump. Wouldn’t want my pedigreed blog having to resort to
McDonald pitches to bring up its own worth.
