![The Corporation](/assets/images/TheCorporation.jpg) I know I'm late to the
game, but since I rely on Netflix, I'm always watching movies long after
the general population has seen them. However, we just finished watching
the documentary "[The
Corporation](http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?trkid=73&movieid=60034810)"
and I couldn't recommend it more if you haven't seen it already.

Even if you're a tried and true Capitalist (like I am), it's worth
watching as it does a pretty good job of raising questions about how we
define wealth and corporate responsibility among other things.

It certainly provides insight into the question of whether [corporations
should act purely on self
interest](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/04/24/2818.aspx). Corporations
should definitely be responsible to their shareholders, but perhaps also
to their stake holders. If a corporation is owned by people in the U.S.,
but pollutes the air in Chile, it's being responsible to its share
holders, but what about the stake holders?

In the end, I think the big take away from the documentary is that for
corporations to be truly responsible to shareholders, they must redefine
what it means to provide "value" to shareholders. Value is more than
immediate cash profit. Value is also provided via sustainability. Clean
air is valuable. Clean water is value.

A second take away is that when our news agencies are in the pockets of
big corporations, how will people get the truth so they can make more
rational decisions about policy regarding the environment and
corporations? That's a real disheartening topic.

Well not one to underestimate human nature, it leaves me with the big
question of how do you make it profitable for companies to be
sustainable? That's certainly one way to enact change. But it has to be
done in such a way that it is inherently profitable to be sustainable.
Enacting policies might just make corporations leave U.S. soil. One
approach is to wait till the environment has been plundered so much that
there's no other way. I'd prefer we not wait so long.
