This is my feeble attempt win an all expense trip to the PDC this year.
All I have to do is explain why I want to attend. Unfortunately, I’ll be
judged on creativity, value to the community, writing quality and style.
It was my hope that my dashing good looks and slipping someone a freshly
minted bill would suffice.

Well the reason I want to attend is simple, it’s to play XBox 360... AND
to get a heads up on the upcoming technology Microsoft is churning out.
I’m particularly interested in future versions of VS.NET and ASP.NET. I
hope to get some ideas to apply to Subtext.

As for sharing with the community, there’s this blog thing I have. I’ve
recently inherited a video camera so I will very likely place videos and
photographs on here, along with witty and insightful commentary
(assuming I can hire that witty and insightful off-shore ghost writer).
Like a relentless avalanche, I’ll go door to door and tell people in
person if that’ll help.

Lastly, I’d like to drop the **economic argument**: I live in Los
Angeles, so Microsoft can stay lean and mean and save a buck on the air
fare voucher, though I’d gladly accept the hotel accomodations. Bill and
Steve will pat you on your back for your resourcefulness.
