A while back I blogged about a hilarious Dave Chappelle skit called (and
if you tend to read aloud, I recommend reading the next words silently)
"[The Niggar Family](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/02/06/169.aspx)"
(and please note that the derogatory N-word is spelled differently lest
you flame me miserably).

Unfortunately, the search word that brings the most visitors to my site
via Google is "Niggar". Egads! A mispelling of a most offensive epithet
is NOT what I want to be associated with. I can only hope that these
users are indeed searching for the skit video and aren't a bunch of bad
spelling ignorant racists.

As you might guess, the search phrase that brings the most visitors is
"Niggar Family". That post has seen 7881 web views according to .Text's
reporting. In second place is the phrase "German Car Video" (25,981 web
views). You'll just have to [watch
it](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/05/22/465.aspx) to see why.

My most popular post of all time is "[Nerds Protest The
RNC](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/30/987.)" (41,635 web views).
It's the photo of the sign with the html tag "\</bush\>.

So like Molly, I've had my share of being an Accidental Blogger. The day
I write a technical post (the intent of my blog) that matches those
numbers is the day I say to myself that haacked.com has done good (thus
exposing my poor grammar skills).
