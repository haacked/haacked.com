From the [Lessig blog I learned
that](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002978.shtml) Microsoft is
releasing its spec for “Simple Feed Extensions” under a Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike license, often referred to as a
“[CopyLeft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft)” . People are free to
modify and redistribute the spec so long as the modifications are
licensed under a similar license.

This shows a couple things about Microsoft. First, that it is not (and
probably never has been) a mono-culture. Secondly, that groups within
Microsoft get it when it comes to RSS and know how to play nice. Bravo!
