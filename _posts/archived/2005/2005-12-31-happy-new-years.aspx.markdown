I’ll try not to bore you with the typical reflections of the past year.
Yesterday it pretty much rained all day, ruining our NYE plans. But
where one door is closed, another door opens. We ended up having a grand
time at our friends place playing board games and drinking white
russians. A toast to 2006!

By the way, I have to give a shout out to my soccer buddies. These are a
diverse group including some amazing soccer players of a range of ages
who showed up despite the rain to get a sweet game on. It rained the
entire time except for the last 15 minutes or so. You gotta love that
type of devotion (or is it insanity?).

My favorite play was the one in which involved a give and go between a
teammate and his mother. A mother son play steals the day.
