Akumi and I decided to turn the business trip into a short weekend
getaway. After the meeting, we all went out to Espetus, a brazilian
[churrasco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churrasco) place. Each table
had a simple dial. Turn it to green and the waiters with the sticks keep
coming to your table offering slices of sweet glorious meat. Turn it to
red to put a temporary end to the gluttony. Needless to say, it took an
extreme amount of willpower to turn that dial to red once we set it to
green.

ate at a fantastic Dim Sum place, the name escapes me right now but we
have the card somewhere.

Once again gorging ourselves, we were pleased to have a bill with a
grand total of just some pocket change over twenty bucks. What a deal!

We then met up with an old friend of Akumi’s and the friend’s wife. The
friend is a product designer and works for the very well regarded IDEO.
His wife works at a marketing agency and is responsible for the Banana
Republic account. They are what are known as “creative types”.

After a great time with them, we checked out some stores, I played with
the PSP at the Sony Metreon, then we headed over to Oakland to catch a
plane back. Now I’m up way too late for my own good hacking away at this
blog. Good night.
