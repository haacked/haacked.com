Went to watch a friendly between Chivas USA and Osasuna of La Liga (Spanish premier league) at the Home Depot Center Saturday night. Thanks to a soccer buddy Ed (who happens to work for Fox Sports World), Akumi and I were sitting in some pretty nice seats.
Near the end of the rather unexciting game, we were invited by Ed's friend to see the luxury suite. And when he said "THE" luxury suite, he wasn't kidding. It was the stadium owner's double sized suite right on the 50. Very nice.
