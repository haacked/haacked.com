Every day I look at my current code and go, “Damn, that's some sweet
shit!” But I also look at code I wrote a month ago and say, “What a
freakin' idiot I was to write that!” So in a month, the code I'm writing
today will have been written by an idiot.

It looks like I am not the only one who feels that way.
