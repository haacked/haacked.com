![Flag](https://haacked.com/assets/images/UsFlag.jpg) The United States is like
your family, it’s got its problems and can seem dysfunctional at times,
but you gotta love it, and it sure beats being in some of them other
countries.

So a toast to July 4th, the day the British learned that outsourcing key
operations to those whose goals don’t align with their own can lead to
disastrous results.

**Note:** I am not inherently against outsourcing, and in fact am a big
fan of it when it is strategic. However, too many businesses use it as a
cover for their mismanagement. You also don’t outsource your key
competencies and critical services. And when you do outsource, you get
what you pay for, so make sure your partners goals align with your own.
When the Hessians just want your money, they’re toast.
