Props to any,one who can tell me the song and artist that my subject
line refers to.

Sunday afternoon I flew to NYC, stayed at the W on Lexington (nice), had
a Long Island Ice Tea (to commemorate), woke up the next morning, caught
a train to Long Island for a meeting, found out our approach to a big
project was all wrong (the product guys on their side love it, but the
keeper of the tech gates changed his mind), caught a plane back to L.A.
(business class upgrade. Loved it), and am now back to work.

One night business trips across the country suck. I didn't have time to
hang with my buddy Dave out there. I called him when I got in. It was
only midnight, you would think he'd still be working. Slacker.
