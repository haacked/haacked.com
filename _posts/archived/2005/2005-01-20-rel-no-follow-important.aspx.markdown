There's a debate going on about how effective the rel="nofollow"
solution really is. [Some
believe](http://yexley.net/blogs/bob/archive/2005/01/19/1143.aspx) that
Google is flattering itself by thinking that the primary motivation for
comment spam is Google juice.

I do not believe that rel="nofollow" will stop comment spam as I've
[stated before](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/20/1939.aspx) (though
I've [applied it](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/19/1933.aspx)
myself). Getting their links out there may be motivation enough. However
I think it will have a bigger impact than some people think.

In terms of sheer economies of scale, I don't think comment spam is like
regular email spam. Sending an email to millions of users is very easy
both technically and costwise. Buy a list and start sending. Comment
spamming millions of websites takes a lot more work.

The primary benefit to comment spam was that a sites page rank
increased. Think of it this way, if I spam 100 sites, that might
increase my exposure a little, say 10,000 people come via those sites.
But suppose those 100 sites increases my page rank and now scores of
users are finding my site via Google. That's where the big financial
impact comes in. Those 100 sites might now bring in 1,000,000 users.
(I'm pulling these numbers out of my ass but I'm probably not too far
out there).

Removing the Google juice increases the comment spammer's work by a
factor of 10 or even 100 to get the same financial impact. This might
not stop the comment spammer, but it will hopefully put a damper on
their activities in the long run.
