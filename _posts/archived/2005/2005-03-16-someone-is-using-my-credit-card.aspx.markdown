shopping spree with our credit card number. Fortunately the Bank of
America protection kicked in before they could do too much damage and we
will not be charged for the fraudelent activity. It's mind bogglingly

Walter writes about placing a fraud alert on your credit file as well as
the California Credit Freeze option. I highly recommend [taking a look
