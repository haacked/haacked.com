![Spam](/assets/images/spam.jpg) Before I mention this, I better knock on wood
and cross my fingers so as not to jinx it, but I haven’t had any comment
spam for several days. In fact, for the past month, the amount of
comment spam on my blog has been greatly reduced. Is `rel="nofollow"`
actually working despite the naysayers? Or have I become such a small
fry, that I am not worth the extra CPU cycles and bandwidth to graffiti
my site?

Not that I’m complaining, mind you. I love it! I doubt it will last for
long, but I can enjoy it while the calm lasts. I just hope it isn’t one
of those things where by mentioning it, I bring it on myself.

Whatever the reason, I’ll still be working hard to make sure
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/) is resilient to spam.
