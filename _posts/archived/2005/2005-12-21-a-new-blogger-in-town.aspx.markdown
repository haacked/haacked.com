My good friend Micah finally [started a blog](http://micahdylan.com/).
He is the CEO of my company, VelocIT, which
makes him a business partner as well as a friend.

Micah is one of those “deep thinkers” which explains why he has two
posts already and nothing technical. Just some philosophical rubbish.
Come on Micah, show us your code! ;)

All kidding aside, I expect you’ll see some insightful writing on
software development, management, etc... This guy used to be a Java
programmer so he’s, switched to C#, and now just bosses me around. He
has seen the industry from both sides and has a lot of interestings
things to say. Now he can just write them down.
