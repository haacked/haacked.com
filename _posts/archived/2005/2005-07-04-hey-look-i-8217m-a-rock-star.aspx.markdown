I don’t know who these people are, but [How To
Rockstar](http://howtorockstar.blogspot.com/) just [wrote up my blog
with a very nice
review](http://howtorockstar.blogspot.com/2005/07/rockstar-haacked.html)
*(thanks guys, I see you got the check I sent)*.

Seriously though, when someone says something this glowing about my
blog, you gotta wonder when they are going to hit me up for money.
Here’s a flattering (almost sycophantic) snippet...

I’m happy to oblige. Five years from now, everyone will be thinking
“Haacked? Nah, never heard of him.”. Oh, and also in five years, we’ll
be remaking blogs rather than movies.

Anyways, I can’t wait to tell our friends Tim and Laura who already call
me and my wife “Rockers” as in “Rocker Phil”.
