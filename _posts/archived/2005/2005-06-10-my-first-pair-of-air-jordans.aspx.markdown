So it's maybe thirteen years too late, but I finally have my first pair
of Air Jordans. Yeah, they don't have anywhere near the cachet they did
back in the day, but hey, better late than never. Here's a photo to
commemorate the occasion.

 Michael thanks you... all the way to the bank.

I remember when I was a high-school ball player (made JV. At 5' 9", I
was a bit short for Varsity), I positively drooled at the idea of owning
a pair of Air Jordans when they came out. They defined hotness for the
realm of basketball shoes, though they seemed to do little to actually
improve my teammates' skills. I remember one point guard in particular
who claimed the coveted title of being the "First" to own a pair
(Remember how important it was to be the **"First"**? New toilet model
coming out. I had it first!). He would show up to practice in head to
toe Jordan gear complete with the tongue sticking out and proceed to
build a very sturdy tenenment with the bricks he tossed up.

For a military brat, these emblems of Basketball glory were outside the
realm of affordability. But now as a hot-shot independent consultant,
they are still outside the realm of affordability. The difference now is
that I have less sense, so I bought a pair anyways. They certainly are a
lot cheaper than they were back in the day.

To justify this purchase, I give you a picture of my last pair. As you
can see, I do wait till the last minute and beyond, before buying a new
pair of shoes. Now excuse me while I purchase a new pair of Copa
Mundials to replace my thoroughly trashed soccer cleats.

 Look what the cat dragged in.
