ReSharper is no longer going to be the super bargain it currently is as
they are raising the price. Even at \$149, it's a worthwhile product.
But if you see yourself doing development with VS.NET 2003 for a long
while (and don't kid yourself, you will be), I highly recommend giving
this product a twirl.
