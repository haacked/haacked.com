As a developer, I like choice. For example, WiX doesn't currently
support managed custom actions. You can hack it together, but they won't
support your endeavor. Personally, I want the choice to shoot myself in
the foot with a managed custom action. Hand over that gun!

However, too many choices can be quite paralytic as well. You ever try
to round up more than four coworkers for lunch and figure out where to
go? So it comes as no surprise that having too many options in a company
401 (k) actually decreases overall enrollment (as reported by The Wall
Street Journal). My buddy Walter here has a [analysis of the
topic](http://spaces.msn.com/members/waltimate/Blog/cns!1pCvw_V_FwCgTXneX4GXlXLw!308.entry).
