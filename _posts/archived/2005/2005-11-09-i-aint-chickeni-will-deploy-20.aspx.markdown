![Chicken](https://haacked.com/assets/images/chicken.jpg) An IM conversation I
had with a teammate on a project today...

> haacked: Hey, let's just switch the whole proj to VS.NET 2005 while
> I'm fixing things.
>  Teammate: i can't tell if you're kidding or not
>  haacked: kidding.
>  haacked: sort of.
>  Teammate: yeah... we should be brave... but maybe a little later
>  haacked: what? Are you chicken? **BWOK! BWOK! BWOK!** *(emphasis
> added... editor)*
>  Teammate: i ain't chicken!
>  haacked: <!-- (Because that's so effective a motivator)
>  Teammate: dude, i'll recompile in .Net 2.0 and deploy to production
> right now!
>  haacked: I DARE You! Do it man! Do it!
>  Teammate: well, i would but i don't have 2005 installed on this
> machine... but otherwise, i would totally do it
>  Teammate: man if i had 2005 installed, you'd be so moded

Notice that after all these years, the power of the *BWOK* *BWOK* still
has its sway. It’s the real reason that lemmings jump off of cliffs. It
isn’t because the other lemmings do it. It’s because one brash lemming
challenged the others by calling them chicken and making the *BWOK BWOK*
sound. Perhaps said lemming even flapped his furry little arms in a
chicken imitation. That seems to really get people’s...er...feathers
ruffled.

Oh, and if you are a current or potential client, I would never simply
deploy a new platform mid-project like that. But this other guy might.
;)
