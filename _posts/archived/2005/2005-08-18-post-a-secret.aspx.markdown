UPDATE: They now have a book on Amazon.com!

[This site](http://postsecret.blogspot.com/) (postsecret.com) is one of
the most interesting, compelling and touching (*in that pulling the
heart strings kind of way, not in the Michael Jackson sort of way,
though there is a bit of that I suppose*) website/blog I’ve ever had the
pleasure of discovering. I found it via [Ian White’s
blog](http://ianwhite.is-a-geek.net/ "Ian White's blog"). (Apparently he
is a geek.)

This is a site where people anonymously send a postcard with a secret.
Some are sad, others are anger inducing, and then there are the humorous
ones like this one.
