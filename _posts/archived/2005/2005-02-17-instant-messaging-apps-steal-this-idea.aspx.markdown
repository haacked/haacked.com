I want an add-in to my instant messaging apps whereby if someone
responds to a message by me with just the word "ok", it doesn't pop an
instant message window if I've closed the window. Perhaps it can filter
any messages with just the word "ok" and flash the system tray or
something. Anything. Just don't get in my way.
