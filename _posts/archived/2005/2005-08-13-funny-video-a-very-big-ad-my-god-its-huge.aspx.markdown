![](https://haacked.com/assets/images/BigAd.jpg) Man, I’ve been so heads down
busy with work lately that I haven’t had time to regale you with the
fantastical events that have been going on around here. Tales of
wizards, warriors, and actuarials. Seriously, kick-ass actuarials.

Instead, I’ve simply been linking to other people’s mindless drivel,
rather than producing my own. However, I did have a moment to breathe
today and watch this [hilarious
video](http://www.hugi.is/hahradi/bigboxes.php?box_id=51208&f_id=1395).

Seriously, go check it out. Now! Satisfaction guaranteed or your money
back. If I have ever lead you astray with one of these video links, you
let me know. But I don’t think I’ve gone wrong yet. Except for maybe
that [chair sex video](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/07/11/roof-sex.aspx/).
You know, the one that put Paris Hilton out of business. Seriously,
furniture fornication was probaby out of line.
