Yesterday I [wrote
about](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/04/21/2764.aspx) a neat
[Trillian](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/)feature that highlights words
with their [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) definition.

Today [Dimitri](http://glazkov.com/blog/) told me via [MSN
Messenger](http://messenger.msn.com/) that I caused him to buy some
music online. While I was out for a walk, I had left my iTunes playing.
I'm using the new 7.0 version of MSN Messenger which allows you to
automatically publish what you are currently playing as your status
message. Apparently something I was listening to (as I have fantastic
taste in music) caught his attention enough that he clicked on the song
and bought it.

You have to love these small details that make software more interesting
to use. Trillian's wikipedia integration puts knowledge at your
fingertips (to use a much bandied about Microsoft phrase), while
Messenger connects us via the universal language of music. I love
checking Messenger to see what people are playing at any given moment.

So [Dare](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/) (currently playing
something by, whoelse?, 50 cent), much kudos to you and your team on the
latest messenger as well as for helping unleash the inner consumer whore
within each of us. :)
