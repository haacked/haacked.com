While it may be exciting to see Microsoft jumping aboard the web-based
application bandwagon, something that I am experiencing right now
reminds me why I think there is still a strong place for rich “smart”
clients.

There is an important piece of information in an email someone sent me
and when I try to login to GMail I get...

> Gmail is temporarily unavailable. Cross your fingers and try again in
> a few minutes. We're sorry for the inconvenience.

At least with a rich client like Outlook, I would have had that email on
my local machine. I also use Yahoo Notepad for important information and
have had that site be down a few times when I needed a critical piece of
information. It makes me realize that I shouldn’t trust these services
to host my important data. I want it on my own machine where I can get
to it.
