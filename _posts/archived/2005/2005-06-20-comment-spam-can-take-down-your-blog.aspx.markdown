![spam](/assets/images/spam.jpg) I can have a very filthy mouth when pissed
off. Take today for example, my dog was witness to a blistering stream
of profanities as I found that my site was down. I was hit with a
torrent of comment spam like nothing I’ve seen before.

Since I have my blog configured to send me an email when someone
comments, the mail server was trying to send out 500 messages in five
minutes. At least according to my hosting provider who turned off my
site in response to the massive flood of email. All in all, the spammers
posted over a thousand messages in a very short while.

This of course prompted me to perform an emergency upgrade of my blog to
the latest unreleased version of
[Subtext](http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext/). I wasn’t quite
ready to perform this upgrade as I was hoping to get a few more comment
spam fighting features implemented, but I was getting tired of the
bombardment.

In the process I fixed a few bugs here and there, mostly related to the
difference between developing on your own server but being hosted on a
shared server.

At least now, I can throttle comments so that too many don’t come in all
at once. This particular storm of comments appears to have originated in
China (at least the comments and urls were in chinese). I think I may
have to post a few posts about freedom, democracy, and the American way
in order to get my blog banned in China. ;)
