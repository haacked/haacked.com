Brian had some sort of conference to attend, so I didn't get to see much
of him. But last Thursday he was at Venice Beach so I took a break from
my work and drove out there. Soon enough, we got to doing that which all
brothers must do when they haven't seen each other in a while.

Yeah, real nice to see you too!
