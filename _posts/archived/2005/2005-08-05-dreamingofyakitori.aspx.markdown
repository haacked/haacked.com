Well I am back home in the good ol’ U.S. of A and strongly feeling the
effects of jet lag despite the few coffees I’ve had in a pathetic
attempt to stave off the lethargy.

Despite many of the fancy schmancy meals we had (which were all
extremely delicious), my favorite meal was when we went out to a gritty
smoky Yakitori place in a nook underneath the train tracks in the Ginza
district. As you can see in the photo to the right, the place is tucked
against the curving wall of the tunnel.

This was my father-in-law’s favorite Yakitori place, so we brought along
a picture of him taken at this place and sat down to enjoy some beer,
sake, and delicious Yakitori. A close family friend surprised us by
joining us, a full hour and forty minutes by train from his work place.

I wish I could find a Yakitori place in Los Angeles that was even half
as good as this place.
