![Whose Line](https://haacked.com/assets/images/WhoseLineIsIt.jpg) Ok, I may
have misfired with the last video, but this is truly hilarious. It
passed the “Wife Test” (the last one didn’t).

I hear this is an old one, but it is a clip from the humorous Improv
show, “Whose Line Is It Anyways?” with Drew Carey, Wayne Brady, etc all

In this one, Richard Simmons is a guest.

[Watch
it!](http://www.heavy.com/heavy.php?videoPath=../content/carnage/flash_video/whosline)
(this time, I did not forget to link to it). It takes a bit of time to
download and get started, so be patient.
