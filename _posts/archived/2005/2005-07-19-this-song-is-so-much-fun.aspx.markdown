I’ve been pretty head down lately with work. But I just had to take a short break to blog this sweet funky song. The refrain is too catchy. You can click on the image to the right to sample the CD at Amazon.

> I hope to see you soon
>  In La La Land.
>  Something about those little pills
>  unreal
>  the thrills
>  they yield
>  until they kill a million brain cells.

I have a feeling he’s not singing about a particular physical location,
but “La La Land” is a common term for Los Angeles. Breathing the air
here will have the same effect as the little pills he mentions.

*Disclaimer* This blog in no way promotes nor condones drug use. It
promotes interesting music. Just assume the lyrics are discussing
aspirin. Very potent aspirin.
