Today Akumi and I hiked the Paseo Miramar trail. To get there, simply
take the PCH North till you get to Sunset. Take a right onto Sunset, and
go up a little ways till you see Paseo Miramar on the left. Take it till
it dead ends and look for street parking.

The trail itself almost instantly has gorgeous views of the Pacific and
the coast line of Santa Monica. Unfortunately, today was a bit hazy. I
was hoping for the clarity that most assuredly would have been the
result had we hiked just after the rains.

The hike itself is around 5 miles (round trip) and at the end you're
greeted with a nice overlook.

On the way back, we met one of the native inhabitants of the Santa
Monica Mountains.
