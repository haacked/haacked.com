[Saw this](http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/poster.asp) on the Snopes site
about a Coke ad that Coca Cola released and then had to recall because
of a hidden risqué image. Pretty damn funny. It just shows that
companies shouldn’t skimp on QA.

Here’s a small version of the ad. See if you can find the offending
image. Then click on the image to see the closeup.
