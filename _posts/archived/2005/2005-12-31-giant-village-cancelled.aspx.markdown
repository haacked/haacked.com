So it looks like our New Years Plans have been derailed by the rain and
the ~~Fire Marshall~~ event organizers as reported by the [fire
department’s
blog](http://lafd.blogspot.com/2005/12/organizers-cancel-la-giant-village.html).
It stopped raining an hour ago, but the wet conditions and the sheer
amount of electrical equipment needed for Giant Village has made it a
safety hazard. Bummer.
