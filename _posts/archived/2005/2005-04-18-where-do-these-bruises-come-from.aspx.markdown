![Elbow](/assets/images/elbow.jpg) Yesterday Akumi pointed at my elbow in shock
and asked me what happened.

"What happened to what?" I replied?

"Your elbow. It's badly bruised."

Sure enough my entire elbow is covered in a dark shade of reddish
purple. "Huh. How about that. I have no idea." I did go to a party the
night before, but I'm pretty sure I managed to stay on my feet the
entire night. I don't remember getting injured during soccer. It just
showed up.

I'll be sure to install a web-cam in the bedroom tonight. I have a
sneaking suspicion that Akumi beats me while I sleep. If she does, it's
probably well deserved as I've been known to elbow her in the head while
we sleep from time to time.... Hmmm. I better check her head.
