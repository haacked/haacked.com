UPDATE: Looks like I was sleeping during my class on 70s funk. It was
Albert Hammond who wrote *It Never Rains In Southern California*, not
Kool and the Gang. Thanks [Jeff](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/).

![Raining in Los
angeles](https://haacked.com/assets/images/RainingLosAngeles.jpg) It’s really a
funny site to see how Angelenos [freak
out](http://blogging.la/archives/2005/09/stormwatch.phtml) when it rains
here.

Contrary to the axioms of ~~Kool and the Gang~~Albert Hammond, it does
rain here in Southern California. Of course it is so infrequent that
people talk of the last time it rained as if describing the fish that
got away.

> Why, the last rain made the Noah episode look like spit in the desert.

In any case, the sound of rain on the rooftop and thunder in the
distance makes it very hard to get out of bed for me. But out of bed I
am as I have plenty of work to do.
