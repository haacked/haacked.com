My former coworker who wrote that 2600 article [I mentioned
recently](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/08/29/9748.aspx) sent me this
link to a [GameSpot
review](http://www.gamespot.com/mobile/puzzle/skilljam/review.html?part=rss&tag=gs_reviews&subj=6132633)
of SkillJam Arcade.

This is the last project the both of us worked on while at SkillJam. We
essentially developed all the back-end support and integration into the
existing tournament engine for the mobile version of the games. It is
quite satisfying to see our work reviewed in a major online publication.
Most of the work I have done in the past wasn’t geared toward the
consumer market and thus wouldn’t be featured by any reviews.
