Just to put housing prices in Los Angeles in perspective, we bought our
small 1000 sq foot town house condo a year and a half ago. I just found
out this week that our neighbors sold their comparable unit for 30% more
than we paid for ours. It boggles my mind.

Of course, the urge is to cash in on the place, but then what? We love
it in Los Angeles so we’re not ready to leave to cheaper pastures. Even
with the equity we have, we still wouldn’t be able to afford a nicer
place than we have unless we move out to the boondocks. Not to mention
that rent on a unit like ours is more than we are paying in monthly
mortgage fees. Instead, we plan to continue riding the housing wave and
hope that if the bubble bursts (which I hope it doesn’t), it won’t burst
30%.
