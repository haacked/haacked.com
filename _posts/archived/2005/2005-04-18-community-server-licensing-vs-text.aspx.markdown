Before you upgrade to Community Server, be aware that they've turned it
into [a commercial
product](https://store.telligentsystems.com/FamilyProducts.aspx?id=1).
Yes, there is a [non-commercial license
available](http://www.telligentsystems.com/Solutions/license.aspx?File=forums-source.exe),
but it requires you to display the following image at the bottom of
every page.

![CS EULA](/assets/images/CSEULA.GIF) I have no problem giving credit where
credit's due, but this is in stark contrast to the [BSD license employed
by .TEXT](http://scottwater.com/License/) and you should be aware of
this if you plan to upgrade to CS.

For example, competitors to Telligent would probably want to purchase
the commerical license rather than have to prominently display their
logo on your blog.

In any case, I'll probably stick with .TEXT and start looking into what
it will take to switch to DasBlog. I think I prefer the more focused
approach DasBlog takes.
