Before I spend time writing my own, does anybody out there know of an
ASP.NET custom control that can render a nice interface for specifying a
connection string?

Honestly, I think a `TextBox` does a pretty fine job of it, but I have
to assume there are better options for those who don’t have the various
connection string formats memorized. Ideally it would allow the user to
select whether they want to use a trusted or integrated security
connection, and based on that selection provide the correct fields to
fill out.
