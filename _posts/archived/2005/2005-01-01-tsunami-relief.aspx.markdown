![Unicef](/assets/images/unicef.gif) We finally have a moment to sit down and
make a donation to the relief efforts under way in South Asia. With the
death toll at 141,000 and rising, it's impossible to grasp the amount of
devastation caused by this disaster.

Although it's easy to just not think about it, I hope you consider
taking a small moment and making a small (or big) donation. We chose to
contribute to the [UNICEF relief
effort](https://www.unicefusa.org/site/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp?c=duLRI8O0H&b=277271).
You can also contribute to the American Red Cross via
[Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) which is convenient if you're an
Amazon user.
