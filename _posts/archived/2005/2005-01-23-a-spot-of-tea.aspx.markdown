Being married to a Japanese woman, I've cultivated a love of tea.
Although Koreans have great tea as well, it doesn't figure as highly in
the culture as it does for the Japanese.

My favorite tea is a type of [Green Tea](http://www.adagio.com/green/)
called
[Gyokuro](http://www.adagio.com/green/gyokuro.html?SID=789387aa1185deeb87901f19a6b1dc16).
It's hard to describe the taste as it has a lot of character and almost
a silky texture that just spreads across the tongue when you drink it.

So to make a long story, the point of this post is to try to earn some
green tea from Adagio teas as part of their [link
rewards](http://www.adagio.com/pages/link_rewards.html) program. Yes I
can be bought with a cup of tea.
