Looking through my statistics today and I noticed that I received a lot
of hits from [this post](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/04/04/cool-google-maps-overlays-satellite-photographs.aspx/) about Google Maps
using satellite photography.

Looking in my referrer logs, I noticed that most of the visits were
rolling off of Google form users who were searching for the term "Google
Satelite". I just happened to be the fourth search result on the page.

"Cool" I thought to myself, "but they're all misspelling "satellite".
Then it occurred to me that they weren't the only ones who were spelling
challenged. I had inadvertently misspelled "satellite" in the title of
my post.

I'm probably dredging up yesterday's news here, but it occurred to me
that one could really get great search results for hot search words by
misspelling them in ways that people commonly misspell them. This is the
same thinking behind someone who tries to register "amazn.com" or
"micrsoft.com" hoping that millions of typos will send users their way.

So if you want to be THE blog about "onomatopoeia", start writing about
your love of "onomatopeia" or "onomatopoea". That'll create some buzz.

I'll have to figure out a way to register "hacked.com".
