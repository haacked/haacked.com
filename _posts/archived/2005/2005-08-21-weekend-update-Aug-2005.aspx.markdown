Putting the ball in the back of the net in a competitive game of Soccer
is one of the most exhilarating feelings around. Why, I think it can
feel as good as ... well I won’t go there. Suffice to say, it’s a great
feeling, even in a city rec league. As long as there are teammates
patting you on the back, refs blowing a whistle and a net to capture the
shot, it just feels great.

Scoring two in a game, well, that’s even better.

Missing a third great game-winning opportunity, well that almost makes
you forget about the first two in frustration. That’s the nature of
sport.

My league team that played so dreadfully last season has bounced back
this season and we are riding high on an unbeaten streak. We won our
last three or four games in a row until this past sunday when we could
only pull out a 2-2 tie, both scored by yours truly. Unfortunately, I
had a fantastic opportunity to put the game away off a corner kick. I
beat the goalie with my header but a defender standing in the goal
headed it out just in time. A great defensive play, much to my dismay.

I attribute my personal improvement to taking the entire weekend off
from work, which was a welcome and refreshing break. It’s amazing what a
full weekend away from the computer (apart from checking emails and
reading blogs which don’t count) can do for a person’s sanity. I
recommend it.

Last night after the game, we went out to dinner in K-town for some
Soon-Dubu (Korean Spicy Tofu Stew). I love Soon-Dubu. The spicier the
better. Unfortunately, it has its downsides the day after. For those of
you familiar with Korean food, you know exactly what I’m talking about.
Let’s just say spicy going in, spicy going out and leave it at that.
