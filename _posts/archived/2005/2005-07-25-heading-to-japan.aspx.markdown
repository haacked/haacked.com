![Tokyo](https://haacked.com/assets/images/TokyoAtNight.jpg) Tomorrow we head
off to Tokyo, Japan for a memorial service to celebrate the life of my
wife’s father. We’ve both been very busy with our respective work,
plowing ahead head down. It finally feels good to lift our heads above
the chaos and exclaim...

> Holy Shit! We’re leaving for Japan tomorrow and we haven’t packed!

In any case, we are looking forward (as always) to staying with Akumi’s
mother and her wonderful cooking. The geek in me enjoys the
technological aspect of visiting Tokyo as much as the food. It’s like
visiting the Epcot center only cleaner and the people with the high tech
gadgets are real, not animatronic.

If I have the time, I’ll try posting a few pics here and there while in
Japan. Ja Mata Ne!
