I don't understand this mode of thinking. Should people in general act
purely on self interest and not for the common good? Why should
corporations be any different? After all, they are made up of people,
both shareholders and employees. It seems not all companies agree as
Boeing, Nike, Coors, HP, and others supported the bill.

I suppose Microsoft would have continued to support the bill if it was
rewritten to state that gays are not protected under anti-discrimination
laws to own stocks in major corporations. Oh then you'd see some major
rallying around gay rights.

I understand that having a corporation get behind a political cause is a
touchy situation. Whose values do you support? Your employees? Your
shareholders? America at large? But it's clear that this bill supports
values Microsoft already holds dear. Microsoft has in the past supported
this bill and has shown itself to be progressive in its own policies.

And [Ballmer's worry](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/stories/2005/04/23/steveBallmersEmailAboutAntidiscriminationBill.html)
of discriminating against anti-gay bigots is a real piece of work.
Here's a snippet.

As [Shelley eloquently points out](http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/04/24/gay-rights-and-blue-screen-of-death/),
this bill doesn't deny rights to others. And the message would have
already been sent by the fact that Microsoft's own policies are
reflected in this bill. So if you're worried about the bigots feelings
Mr. Ballmer, are you going to change your policies to reflect that as
well?

We've all seen what acting purely on corporate self-interest produces.
Oh, Enron springs to mind, sweat shops, destruction of the environment,
and countless other examples. Corporations have all the rights of a
person without many of the implicit responsibilities. Corporations are
members of the community. It's time they start acting like it.
