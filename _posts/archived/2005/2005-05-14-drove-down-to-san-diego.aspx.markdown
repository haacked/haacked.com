Yesterday we drove down to the San Diego area to spend the day with
Akumi's dad in Chula Vista, right on the border with Mexico. Trips to
visit her dad end up being culinary expeditions of the highest quality.
For lunch, we had some of the most delicious Ton-Katsu since Japan.
Unfortunately we stuffed our faces so much that by the time we went to
dinner, we were still a bit full and couldn't enjoy the meal. Which was
too bad because we went to the best Sushi place in San Diego. Perhaps
the best in Southern California. Sushi Ota.

It's a rather non-descript little place in a small strip mall that has
been rated by Zagat as the best all around restaurant in San Diego (not
sure what its current rating is), not just the best Sushi restaurant. If
you call ahead for reservations, ask to be seated in front of Mr. Ota.
He doesn't work many days of the week, so you might need to call ahead,
but it's worth it.
