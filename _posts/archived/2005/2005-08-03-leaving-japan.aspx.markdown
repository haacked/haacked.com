In ten minutes we’re getting on the train to go to the Narita airport. I
always feel sad when leaving, but excited to get back to work and the
exciting opportunities therein. The fact we are flying Singapore
airlines is some consolation. They have a fantastic in-flight
entertainment system. If only they had wi-fi.
