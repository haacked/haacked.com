The great people at [WebHost4Life](http://webhost4life.com/) moved my
database and web server to new Windows 2003 servers. They put them in
the same server block and I noticed a significant speed increase in the
time it takes my blog to load. This explains why my site was down this
morning.

Hopefully, this server has much less abusive tenants than my last one
did.
