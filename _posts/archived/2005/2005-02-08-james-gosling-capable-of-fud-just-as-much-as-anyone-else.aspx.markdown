I love [Ian's
response](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2005/02/08/goslingmcpp)
to James Gosling's opinion on .NET's C++ support and it's supposed
inherent insecurity. It's basically a "Booyah! In your face" piece as he
bit by bit dissects Goslings arguments and presents a Java example that
directly contradicts Gosling claim that type unsafety is incapable in
Java.

Ian, you're the man! If you're in L.A., I need to buy you a pint.

It just goes to show that it's not just Ballmer who spreads the FUD
thick. It's time to bridge the Java/.NET divide and be reasonable here.
The "religious" wars aren't worth the time and energy. Quit spreading
FUD in both directions and realize that both technologies have their
weaknesses and strengths. It's really disappointing to see this type of
FUD from someone as respected as Gosling. I guess I expect that sort of
thing from Ballmer.
