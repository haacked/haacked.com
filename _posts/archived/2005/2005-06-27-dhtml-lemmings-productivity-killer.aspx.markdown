may singlehandedly be responsible for delaying Longhorn, VS.NET 2005,
Yukon and many other products as legions of programmers (Microsoft and
otherwise) lose productivity by spending their time playing [DHTML
Lemmings](http://193.151.73.87/games/lemmings/index.html), a faithful
javascript reproduction of the classic game
[Lemmings](http://www.kallex.de/lemmings/games/official.html).

Lemmings is probably one of the most popular games I’ve never played
until now. It is quite addicting.
