Back in the day, amidst all the stupidity prevalent on the web, there
was one site that dared to raise the banner and take the stupidity one
step higher. That site was, my friends, lostyouth.com.

LostYouth is now defunct due to a corporate scandal involving its
founder who cooked the books like a ragin' cajun and squandered the
money snorting blow of the backs of midget strippers.

However, rising from the ashes like a city in Arizona, lost youth is
back! (Though now it is hosted at a free hosting site. This makes sense
if you were paying attention because the guy squandered all his money.)
Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, the return of
[LostYouth](http://koba.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/).
