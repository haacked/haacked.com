As many of you know, I will be heading to [Burning
Man](http://www.burningman.com/) this weekend. That’ll put a crimp in my
blogging for a week since I won’t be bringing my tablet to the playa.

There are a lot of misconceptions about Burning Man, often propagated by
those who have never attended, but sometimes propagated by those who
have attended and did not understand the event. It is often
characterized as a lot of drugged out former hippies walking around
nude. Certainly you might find a few, but walk the halls of Congress and
you’ll find the same (except for the nude part perhaps). Heck, our
president is an ex-coke abuser.

In reality, Burning man is more of a music/arts festival and an
experiment in radical participatory community and survival. Heck, even
the [CEO of
Google](http://news.com.com/Google+balances+privacy,+reach/2100-1032_3-5787483.html)
has been in attendance in the past.

In any case, just to show how tame this temporary community can be, I
was going over the events calendar and found this gem: [Daily
Mathematics Discussion/Presentations/Lectures
Detail](http://www.burningman.com/calendar/playa/view_entry.php?id=3071&date=20050831).
Sweet!

Oh you know this geek will be there. I may even give a short
presentation as I’ve always liked discussing the [Monty Hall
Problem](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/07/21/836.aspx). It’s a very
simple problem, but there are always holdouts who love to argue against
the correct answer. Besides, I should keep it simple. You really can’t
expect to engage a bunch of drugged out nude hippies in deeper
conversations about the whether axiom of choices should truly be
accepted as an axiom of set theory.
