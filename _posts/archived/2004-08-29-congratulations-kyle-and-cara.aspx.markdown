We just got back from their wedding reception in San Francisco and we
had a great time. I can see that you two will be very happy and I was
honored to take part in the reception. Also, many thanks for the iPod,
an overly generous gift, but one I will make good use of. I now finally
have an iPod. Wohoo!
