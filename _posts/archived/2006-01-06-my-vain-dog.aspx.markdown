I happened to notice my dog Twiggy apparently admiring herself in the
mirror. At one point she was right up against the mirror looking at
herself. By the time I got my camera, she had decided to on a more
comfortable vantage point to check herself out.

And here I am working my ass off while she just lounges around. I really
need to get her a j-o-b.
