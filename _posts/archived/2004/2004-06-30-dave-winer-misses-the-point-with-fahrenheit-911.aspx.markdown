With all due respect, I think Dave misses the point of Moore's questioning. Of course it's a ridiculous question and no parent would say yes. That's the whole point. We're sending children (primarily of the poorer sections of society) to fight and die based on conspicuously absent evidence. Where are the WMDs? Where is the tie to Al Queda? Yet our Congress and the President so cavalierly send these troops to Iraq.

Would they be so cavalier if their own children were in any danger of being sent to Iraq? The point of the question is to emphasize that these aren't faceless people we're sending. We're sending the sons of\ daughters of fellow Americans. The point is to get these Congress members to consider the pain they would feel if their own sons and daughters were sent.

As for WWII, I don't believe comparing the Iraq conflict to World War II is a useful comparison. First of all, we were attacked by the enemy we engaged. Iraq did not attack us, Al Queda did. In that effort, kids under 18 faked documents in order to join the effort. People were proud to serve or have their kids serve. It was widely seen as a just and necessary war.
