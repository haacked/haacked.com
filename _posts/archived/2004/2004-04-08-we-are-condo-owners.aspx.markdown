![](/assets/images/igloo.jpg)It’s finally official. We are legally,
emotionally, officially, proud owners of a townhouse style condo. For
you non-LA people, I could buy a 5 bedroom estate in Anchorage, Alaska
for what we're paying. Heck, I could buy a 5 bedroom house in Seattle or
Portland.

But what that gets us in L.A. is a two bedroom, 2.5 bath 1000 sq ft town
house condo.
