In case you're wondering (and I know at least one of you is), my blog is
hosted at [WebHost4Life](http://www.webHost4Life.com) and is running
.Text version 0.95 (or is it .96?). I chose it over DasBlog because of
its SQL Server support, but I'm not sure that's such a compelling reason
given that configuration is such a pain. I'm hoping that Community
Server will address many of the issues I have with .Text.

From reading the .Text newsgroups, it appears I'm one of 25 people on
the planet to get it working. Ok, perhaps that is an exaggeration.

I created a custom skin for my blog a few months ago, but the logo was
created by a talented coworker. I also use
[w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) to post to my blog.
