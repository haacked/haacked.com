![BurningMan](/assets/images/TerrorDome.jpg)Unfortunately, my plans for going
to Burning Man this year are not to be. However, it looks like Mr. Sells
and his wife are going.

For my non-geek friends out there, Chris is a popular Windows expert who
has written several books and countless articles on programming for
Windows in its many incarnations. He recently joined Microsoft and is
now a Content Strategist for the next version of Windows.

I went to Burning Man for the first time two years ago. Trying to
describe what it is in words is very difficult. The experience is
different for everyone. For me, it felt like being at a circus carnival
refugee camp on the planet of Tatooine. Sort of.

In the picture attached to this post, you can see me and my wife hanging
around the Mad Max inspired Terror Dome. Every night, this dome would be
covered in people while two combatants attached to cords would swing
around inside whacking each other with foam padded sticks.
