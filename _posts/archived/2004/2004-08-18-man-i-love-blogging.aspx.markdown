I'm hooked! To both reading blogs (via RSS feeds) as well as writing
one. I'm addicted to poking my nose in the comments sections of other
people's blogs. Maybe even where my nose doesn't belong. Almost
certainly where it doesn't belong.

For some odd reason, I love spouting my opinion. I'll just give it out
for free. You didn't ask for it? Well here it is anyways. It's not that
I think I know more than you. Heck, most of the time, I don't even know
if my opinion is right or wrong or even well informed. But I'll probably
give it to you anyways. Perhaps I should think before I speak. But
that's so in the past. I hope you don't mind. I really do like you all.
Perhaps I just like hearing (or reading) myself talk.

I also like trying to be humorous. Now there's an area where I'm even
more likely to fall on my ass. But you can't fault me for trying can
you? You can? Well that's never stopped me before. My wife has learned
that I have a very low embarassment quotient. I continually make a fool
of myself, but am never embarassed by what I do.

The simple fact is that I like belonging to a community, any community.
As long as there's give and take. I write something in my blog or on
someone else's and someone responds. That feels good! Sounds like an old
fashioned conversation you say? Well yes and no. As a conversationalist,
I don't have the resources available to me as a blogger. For example, I
have a terrible memory. In conversation I'll say,

> "Yeah, uh-huh. Umm that's like, a really, like, good point dude. That,
> like, sorta reminds me of a great quote by that old dead guy... ummm
> Spinzer? Something about new ideas and ceasing."

But on a blog, I'm more apt to say,

> Jolly good point chap, and a point well taken if I may say so. It
> reminds me of good old professor Chadwick at Cambridge who was fond of
> puffing on his oaken pipe and would read to us his favorite quote from

> you that a thing does not therefore cease to be true because it is not
> accepted by many."

It's all about “Information At Your Fingertips” brought to us by Google.

Now back to the typical technical mumbo-jumbo.
