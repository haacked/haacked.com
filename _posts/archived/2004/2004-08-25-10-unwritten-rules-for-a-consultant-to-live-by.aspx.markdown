Now I've never been a consultant myself, but I have friends who have
been consultants. Namely
[Kyle](http://koba.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/). What do you think of
these rules?

> 1.  You work for the client, not the consulting firm.  No matter who
>     cuts the payroll check, the client is the one paying for your
>     services.  Do the right thing for the client, not the consulting
>     firm (or anyone else).
> 2.  Your network of consultants is your most important asset.
> 3.  Consultants should keep a blacklist of firms and other consultants
>     that should be avoided, and why.  Share this list with your
>     network of consultants but not to the general public.
> 4.  Do not make negative comments about another consultant within ear
>     shot of an employee of a client, and especially around the sales
>     and marketing people of a consulting firm.  Negative comments are
>     fine between consultants, but, keep it “in the family”.  But,
>     never break rule \# 1.  When dealing with non-consultants, do like
>     your mom always told you, “if you don’t have anything nice to say
>     about someone, don’t say anything at all”.
> 5.  When your consulting firm takes you out to lunch, remember, you
>     are really the one buying lunch.  It is coming out of the
>     consulting firm’s cut out of your rate, so just pretend you are
>     picking up the check.  Would you really want to pay to have lunch
>     with this person?  The same thing holds true for all events and
>     gifts you may get from the consulting firm.
> 6.  Avoid give consulting firms information on possible leads without
>     first getting everything in writing (especially your commission). 
>     And even then, the contract usually isn’t worth the paper it is
>     written on.  Don’t expect to get any money for info on leads, so
>     be careful who you give them out to.
> 7.  When referring another consultant to a consulting firm, expect a
>     finder’s fee.  \$2 per hour is the minimum that they should
>     offer.  Flat fees typically benefit the consulting firm not you,
>     so try to avoid them.  Remember, your finder’s fee is coming out
>     of the consultant’s pocket.  So if the consultant is part of your
>     network, you should waive the fee.  Your network keeps you
>     employed.
> 8.  If you didn’t negotiate your rate starting at the consulting firms
>     billing rate to the client don’t try to find out what it is,
>     unless you are prepared for the consequences.   That knowledge
>     will usually just make you disgruntled.
> 9.  Never tell the client what the consulting firm is paying you.  If
>     they need to know, it is up to the firm to disclose that info (see
>     rules \#1 and \#8).
> 10. Avoid professional days.  You don’t bill for hours you don’t work,
>     so you shouldn’t work for hours that you don’t bill.  A good
>     project plan, with a budget to match it, is a must.  Unless of
>     course, if you created the project plan, then you should live with
>     the mess that you created.
