![Unreal Tournament 2004 Cover](/assets/images/UT2004.jpg) I have a confession
to make. While at Tech-Ed, I did some bad things. Please look upon me
not with a judging eye, but try to have a forgiving stance.

While at Tech-Ed, I missed several sessions I had planned to attend...in
order to...\*gasp\* play Unreal Tournament 2004.

I know. I know. I'm supposed to be at Tech-Ed to learn the latest and
greatest Microsoft technologies, not to waste my time manning the guns
on a Leviathan, or sniping suckers with the lightning gun. But I just
couldn't help it! My boys (and girls, but mostly boys) out there needed
me! I couldn't just ditch my team as the other team was encroaching on
the main base now could I? What did you expect me to do in the face of
such temptation as a setup consisting of 32 networked AMD 64 bit servers
with flat panel displays?

In any case, I've checked myself into Dennis Fong Clinic for 1st person
shooter addicts. I'll get the help I need at the DFC. Hmmm... DFC...
Sounds like a new weapon in UT... Wonder how I get that...
