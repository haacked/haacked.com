![Dubya](/assets/images/Dubya.jpg)This [interesting
piece](http://slate.msn.com/id/2100064/) on
[Slate](http://www.slate.com) presents the idea that perhaps Bush chose
"stupidity" early on as an act of rebellion and has stuck with it even
after beginning to get his act together. An excerpt:

> Why would someone capable of being smart choose to be stupid? To
> understand, you have to look at W.'s relationship with father. This
> filial bond involves more tension than meets the eye. Dad was away for
> much of his oldest son's childhood. Little George grew up closer to
> his acid-tongued mother and acted out against the absent
> parent—through adolescent misbehavior, academic failure, dissipation,
> and basically not accomplishing anything at all until well into his
> 40s.
