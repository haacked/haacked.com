![](/assets/images/googlebillboard.jpg)Google apparently is behind this
mysterious billboard that presents a nice number theory problem. *I love
number theory!*

Of course, I could have written a program to sift through the digits of
e to find the answer to this question, but I’m a pragmatic soul and
figure why not just use Google since it’s 3 AM and I’m tired (I know,
it’s cheating, but how good Google fault you for using Google?) The
answer to this problem is also a website
([7427466391](http://www.7427466391.com/ "digits")) which presents a
more challenging problem.

Keeping in theme with Google’s love affair for the number *e*, I soon
realized (by looking at [this
site](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/e.2mil "Digits of e")
that displays the first 2 million digits of *e*) that each of these
numbers are consecutive 10 digit sequences of *e*.

I’ll give you a hint, if you sum the digits of each number (something I
typically do to see if the numbers are divisible by 3), you*’*ll find an
interesting result (other than they aren*’*t divisible by 3). That
should lead you to the final answer with a bit of coding.

The final answer takes you to a recruiting page. What an ingenious and
clever way to recruit talent, though I suppose by giving away the
answer, I’ve defeated the purpose. How naughty!
