My buddy [Ed](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=mushustyles) posted some pics from Burning Man this year. This pedal powered Ferris wheel particularly caught my eye. How cool is that!

When you can't afford a hamster.

I wish I could have been there to try it. Visit [Ed's blog](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=mushustyles) to see some more great pics.

NOTE: He's got one of them stupid [Xanga](http://www.xanga.com/) blogs so I can't link directly to the entry. You might have to hit the "Next 5" link a few times if you see this much later. The pics were taken on September 29.
