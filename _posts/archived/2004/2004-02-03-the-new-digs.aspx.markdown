So what is up with this ugly new site? Basically it is one of those “Oh
gawd, a developer is trying to design” designs. It is one of the default
designs that comes with a blogging back-end
that I am now using. You’ll also notice that my URL is some funky long
piece of work with "europe" in it. No, I haven’t moved to europe. My
good man Erik pointed me towards free ASP.NET hosting with SQL Server
access. I’m trying it out and hosting my blog here. As for the
design,don’t worry, it is temporary. I have some underground monkeys
working feverishly hard to produce a mind blowing, head splitting, taste
bud exciting new design. Some new features to note:

-   Notice the bright orange image link with the big "XML" on it?  That
    links to my RSS feed. Finally! RSS. Now if I can just get you to
    subscribe to it...
-   Posts are now arranged in categories. So if you could care less
    about .NET (i.e. family members, college buddies), you should
    bookmark the General category. Or better yet, subscribe to the
    General rss feed.
-   Disagree with something I said? You’re a fool. But now you can
    expose your foolishness via comments! Please comment. Please.

Now that I have this in place, I will probably forego sleep in order to
post content worth reading. Come back now, ya heard!
