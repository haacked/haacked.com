[Kyle](http://koba.europe.webmatrixhosting.net) sent me this classic
photo from a friend of his, Brad Kagawa, who was at the RNC protest in
New York. Brad scrambled across the march to take a picture of the
geekiest protest sign he's ever seen.

 Will the W3C support this addition to HTML?

Whoever this person is with the sign, I \<SALUTE/\> you.

Thanks to Brad and Kyle for sending me this.

UPDATE: [BoingBoing.net](BoingBoing.net) has a [great
entry](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/30/rncnyc_daily_geek_pr.html)
about the mixture of tech, art and protest at the RNC. What makes the
blog entry really great is that it includes a link to this post. ;)

UPDATE \#2: And what makes this post great are the ensuing comments
about HTML correctness that inevitably follow when geeks get political.
My I think I'll start posting everything as HTML.

UPDATE \#3: So we may have identified the mysterious sign holder. Her
name is Shalott. Of course, I have no way of confirming, but like
Mulder, I believe! She got the idea from her friend Tzikeh who [saw it
online on a t-shirt](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/31/1031.aspx).
