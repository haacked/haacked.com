I just realized that I haven't been to
[Google.com](https://www.google.com) in a very long time. Maybe months.
Oh, don't get me wrong, I've *used* Google plenty, but now with the IE
Google bar and the Desktop Google bar, I have very few reasons to
actually go to the Google front page. My view of Google lately has been
search results.

So today, I decided to visit the Google front page for old time sakes
now that they've totally revamped their look. Ok, so it's about as
noticeable as the difference between Old Coke and New Coke, but it is
noticeable. I like it.
