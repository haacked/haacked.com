So I know this is basically the geek equivalent to those cheesy email
surveys that go around asking you to answer a bunch of questions about
yourself and then send the questionnaire and your answers to all your
friends, but I have to participate anyways. I found this meme going in a
[blog entry](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/04/19/pagememe)
that asks you to do the following:

> Grab the nearest book. Open the book to page 23. Find the fifth
> sentence. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with
> these instructions.

So there you go. I admit, I don't have every arcane rule of regular
expressions in my head. I often refer to the \^(1+)\$ times a day. It is
truly the [A-Za-z] of regular expressions.
