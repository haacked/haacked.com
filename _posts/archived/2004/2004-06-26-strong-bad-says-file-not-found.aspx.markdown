![](/assets/images/StrongBad.jpg) [Brad Wilson](http://www.dotnetdevs.com/)
(thanks!) pointed me to this hilarious [404 File Not
Found](%0Ahttp://homestarrunner.com/systemisdown.html) page. Give it a
second to kick in (I promise, no zombies will scream). It has my
favorite (and as far as I'm concerned, the funniest) character on the
web, Mr. [Strong Bad](http://homestarrunner.com/vcr_sb.html) himself. If
you haven't acquainted yourself with Strong Bad, now is the time!
