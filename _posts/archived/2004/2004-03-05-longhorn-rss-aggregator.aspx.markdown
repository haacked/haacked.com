I've seen the future and it is good. Adam Kinney has a demo Rss
Aggregator for Longhorn at his site,
[http://www.adamkinney.com/](www.adamkinney.com "Adam Kinney"). It's
very barebones right now, but you can just see the potential for how
beautiful this will and does look. What struck me was how nice the text
of a blog entry looked in the text window. Nice work adam!
