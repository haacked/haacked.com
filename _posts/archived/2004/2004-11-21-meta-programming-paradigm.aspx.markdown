The
[geeks](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/11/22/267634.aspx)
are [abuzz](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MetaProgrammingSystem.html)
about Sergey Dmitriev's
[article](http://www.onboard.jetbrains.com/articles/04/10/lop/) on
Language oriented progamming and the Meta Programming system. It's a
worthwhile read and may be a harbringer of the future of software
development.

What's interesting to me is that the model he describes for viewing
source code trees is very similar to [this
