![](/assets/images/Economist.jpg) Now I'm every bit as much the bleeding heart
liberal as the guy to my left, but I have to say that I believe the
outcry against offshoring and outsourcing is purely a reactionary
response to the current bad economy. I don't believe that opposition to
outsourcing is not based in sound economic principal nor is good for the
country in the long run.

This coming from a software developer who makes his livelihood on custom
software development. However, as jobs start to get created again (they
will) I think the furor will die down a bit because everyone will be too
busy working.

In the meanwhile, read [this

I found from my economist friend Michael Krimm's favorite magazine. He
will be quite proud of me.
