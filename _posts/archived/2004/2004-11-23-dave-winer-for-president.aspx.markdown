Dave [claims
that](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/11/23#When:7:12:24PM) inhaling
puts him out of the running for President.

Not So fast there professor! Our current president managed to get
elected twice and he's a confirmed "snorter". In all likelihood our very
first president smoked a bowl or two in his day. Don't let "inhaling' be
a showstopper.

Perhaps your campaign slogan might be "An RSS feed in every Pot!"
