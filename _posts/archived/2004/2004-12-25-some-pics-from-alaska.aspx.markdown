This is the road out of Anchorage towards Turnagain arm. It's around 10
AM and the sun is just about to rouse its lazy butt above the horizon.

Turnagain arm provides spectacular scenery. During the summer, this
inlet hosts some of the best wind surfing in the world along with Beluga
whales.

It was too cold to take too many pictures, but here's one from the top
of the quad. In the background you can see Cook Inlet where we drove in
from.
