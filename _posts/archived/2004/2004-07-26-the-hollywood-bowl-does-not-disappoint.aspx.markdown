I'm no professional musician, but I thought the acoustics at the
Hollywood bowl was fantastic. They've been touting the improved sound
with the new shell and improvements. The sound was sharp and clear.

The opening act played an Eastern influenced set with guitar, bongos,
and even some Drum & Bass mixed in there. They were accompanied by
Indian dancers on one side and break-dancers on the other. East meets
west. I don't believe for a second that the break dancers are from this
world. I think they are former Gumby rejects in the way they contorted
and flipped. Of course, I've seen just as impressive dancers on 3rd
Street Promenade.

Sidestepper soothed us with "In Beats We Trust", a very reggae-ish funky
tune. Nortec Collective picked up the intensity a notch with some
thumping music. The Crystal Method then brought it home with a nice
selection of a few new tracks and several classics, ending with "Busy
Child."
