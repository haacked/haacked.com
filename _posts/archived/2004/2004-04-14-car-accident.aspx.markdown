I have a perfect eagle eye view of a car accident that just happened on
San Vicente. Looks like a gray SUV slammed into the side of a little red
civic or corolla (can't tell from here on the 17th floor). Funny how all
these cars are slowly driving around it as it blocks most of the
intersection. They just want to get on with their lives. Both passengers
walked out of the car and seem to be having a civil conversation about
it.

Oh, I can hear the sounds of sirens. Looks like the police and ambulance
are showing up to take care of things. That was pretty quick.
