I received this email from a coworker. It makes you stop and think,
doesn't it?

> With all the news coverage about sub-zero east coast weather and north
> Pacific ice storms, it's easy to forget that Southern California has
> its share of devastating weather also. Check out the damage caused by
> a wild west coast storm which recently passed through Los Angeles
> (photo attached.) It really makes you cherish what you have, and
> reminds us not to take life for granted!!!
