![Soccer ball](/assets/images/soccerball.jpg) My team, Nothend United, tied the
Westsiders 2 to 2. Our goalie was phenomenal in staving off their
aggresive attack, but sadly the opponents scored twice by capitalizing
on deflections of our defense that took our goalie out of position. I
scored one off of a penalty kick. For the record, I didn't dive. I never
do.
