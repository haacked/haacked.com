![Resharper](/assets/images/resharper.gif) After hearing so much about how
[IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html) is the ideal
IDE and blows every other IDE to smithereens from various Java pundits
(and even a friend who's a C# and Java developer), I was excited to try
out [Resharper 1.0.2](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html)
from Jetbrains, the maker of IDEA.

Installation went smoothly and I really am impressed with all the
productivity enhancements contained within this tool. Rather than wait
for Whidbey, I can have code expansions and refactoring NOW! The code
formatting feature will surely help your team avoid coming to blows over
such important and divisive issues such as "curly brace on its own line
or after a method declaration?". Everyone can have the code formatted to
his or her own tastes. There's a whole slew of other noteworthy features
I won't go into.

The one problem I have with ReSharper, and this is a doozy, is that it
replaces the VS.NET Intellisense with its own, and its implementation
way too slow for real development. Note that I'm running a fairly decent
machine: Pentium 4 1.7 GHZ 512 MB of RAM. One thing I appreciate about
VS.NET's Intellisense is that it is snappy and can keep up with me. So
it's a huge detriment when I'm typing along and hit "." and have to wait
a second for the auto-completion box to display. I hope there's a way to
disable the auto-completion, but maintain all the other great features.
Otherwise I'm afraid I will have to uninstall this.

Anyone else have good or bad experiences with this product? Any
recommendations?

*UPDATE: I couldn't take it any longer. I had to uninstall this. It's a
shame*
