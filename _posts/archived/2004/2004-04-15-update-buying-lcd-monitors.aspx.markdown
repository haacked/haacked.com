I mentioned that I bought an LCD monitor from some unknow Yahoo store.
Well I recieved it yesterday and I can't tell you how happy I am with
it. I've never seen such a nice, well built, sharp LCD. It took my eyes
a few minutes to adjust as I think they've grown accustomed to blurry
text. In any case, the store sells it for \$399.00 (includes shipping)
which is a steal. Here's the URL

I liked it so much, I am going to purchase another one. However, I need
a graphics card (not too expensive) that supports a dual monitor set up.
Any suggestions? Something around the \$120 range.
