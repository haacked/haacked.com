![Code Complete 2](/assets/images/CodeComplete2.jpg)*Code Complete* by Steve
McConnell was the first programming book that had me glued to its pages
as one would read a page turner thrilling novel. I couldn't put it down.
I still have several scars from the many obstacles I would walk into as

of writing code. Now on the horizon, [Code Complete
2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619670/104-4151528-6682347?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I27SDK7I7JJZR0&colid=2NR9ZWS6ESIXJ "Code Complete 2")
is on pre-sale at Amazon. I can't wait to get my hands on this.
