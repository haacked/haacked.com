![RSS Bandit Logo](/assets/images/RssBanditLogo.jpg) Plug-ins are a powerful
way for users to dynamically enhance the functionality of an installed
application. Is there a high priority feature you want that is low
priority for the developers? Perhaps you can write a plug-in.

Many RSS aggregators support the ability to add plug-ins through the
[IBlogExtension
interface](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/stories/2003/04/0023.html).
Started by Simon Fell, the IBlogExtension is intended to provide news
aggregators an extensibility point so that they can be hooked into 3rd
party blogging tools such as [w.Bloggar](http://www.wbloggar.com/).

RSS Bandit is one such aggregator. I recently added
[documentation](http://www.rssbandit.org/docs/html/advanced/building_and_using_bandit_plugins.htm)
which includes a walkthrough for building a very simple plug-in. Please
let me know if it is helpful or if you find any errors by commenting
here or in the RSS Bandit
[IBlogExtension](http://www.rssbandit.org/forum/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=2)
forum.

I'm working on a more advanced plug-in complete with configuration
settings and a GUI that I will present later.
