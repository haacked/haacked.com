I'll be honest. Basketball is my second favorite sport, but by a slim
margin to that sport of sports, soccer. Being 5' 9", soccer comes more
naturally to me. I only made it to the JV level in high school
basketball, but played at the Varsity and Division 3 college level in
soccer, which is not saying much.

I've started playing basketball at the Y in the morning before work. It
was a slow start, but today I had one of those games that reminds me why
I love this game. I felt like I was firing on all cylinders.

When you take a moment to think about it, the computational output of
your brain while playing sports is amazing. It will take a loooong time
before a robot comes anywhere close. Think of all the unconscious
calculations you make in a split-second play.

> As you are half falling, half stepping, be aware of the other defender

> defenders and one of your teammates is cutting to the basket. About
> time he figured that out. He's got a defender reaching in on his back.
> Is the gap wide enough? Wait a split second, take another dribble,
> hear the footsteps of another defender closing in, hear your stomach
> growl and wonder what you're going to have for breakfast.
> 
> There! The gap is just wide enough. Avoid the hands reaching in and
> throw it off the ground at just the right angle and just slightly in
> front of your teammate so it lands right into his hands, but away from
> his defender. Perfect! A perfect layup. Now enjoy the rush of
> adrenaline and go accept the high-fives and accolades from your
> teammates. Don't trip on the court.

This entire thought process occurrs in about a second. That's the rush
of basketball my friend.
