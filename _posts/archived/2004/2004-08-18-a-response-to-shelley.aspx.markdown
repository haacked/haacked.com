I am glad to hear that her experience has been different from mine. And
I didn't say that I NEVER worked with a female software developer. The
person who first trained me was a female contractor. The president of my
company was a former COBOL programmer. Sadly though the bulk of my
software career (which is an admittedly short 7 years) has not been
spent working with other talented female software developers. I believe
I've missed out due to a lack of diversity.

However, assuming former company's atmosphere is at fault (especially
not being informed about the company) is hardly constructive and is
dismissive of our efforts at the time. It also oversimplifies the real
issue. First, let me give some background.

I worked at a small custom software/consulting services of around 15 to
17 (at the height) people located in Santa Monica. Most likely, our
small size was the biggest factor in our inability to attract women. I
think it had very little to do with the company atmosphere. Consider
that roughly half the employees (at the time) were women, just not
software developers. The president (and half owner) herself was a woman
and a former software developer keenly interested in attracting female
software developers. She lamented the fact that there were so few
candidates.

Our environment was not that of a Dot-Com. We had in-house day care with
a talented and experienced caretaker, reasonable hours, and a flexible
work culture. Our failure to attract women is probably (and I don't know
all the answers here) due to several factors apart from the work
environment. One of the simplest factors is that we were small. Nobody
ever heard of us. The best way we knew to recruit was through job
postings on websites such as Monster.com and Dice.com. However, there
are much bigger societal and gender issues that we were probably bumping
up against.

For example, research shows that not only are women less likely to
separate from a job than men (Kulik, 2000), but also that women conduct
a job search with less intensity than men (Keith, K. and McWilliams). I
think this helps explain why we had so few respondents via the online
job boards.

Cultural biases in our educations system and otherwise also have an
affect on the number of candidates.

I think this points out that there is a real basis in saying that
attracting women to a software development role in numbers on par with
men is a difficult task. And for very small companies, it is difficult
to even attract a few. This is not say that this is a good thing, but
its the situation we're in. Rather than saying "Well you must be doing
something wrong.", we need to ask "What can we do to improve the
situation together?" Given the evidence I put forth, in the next couple
months, I may be in a position to hire a developer or two as a senior
development manager at a different company than the one mentioned here.
What tips would you give me to hiring the best and the brightest?  At
the end of the day, I think we're working toward the same goals.

Absolutely. Nothing sexier than typing on a keyboard all day bathed in
the soft glow of two LCDs. Actually, I sort of fell into it. The remark
that I made in my last post that programming has no "sex appeal" and
that it isn't "sexy", that wasn't intended to be taken literally. My
point is that software development is not generally seen as a field that
can provide a fulfilling career opportunity for women, or the general
public at large. It doesn't have a very positive exposure in the popular
culture. When you ask a classroom of kids what they want to be when they
grow up, you'll hear things such as "Doctor", "Lawyer", "Fireman". Heck,
when you ask highshool freshman, you'll typically hear the same thing (I
know, I used to teach a summer science and math enrichment program for
gifted students about to enter highschool.) . But rarely will you hear
"Computer Programmer." When I was a kid, my answer was always "I want to
be a professional soccer player!"
