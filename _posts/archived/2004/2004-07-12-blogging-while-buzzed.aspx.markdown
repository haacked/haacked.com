![](/assets/images/knobcreek.jpg) I’m going to buck tradition and start a new
craze just because I mean to. Let’s call it, *blogging while buzzed*.
Perhaps it will be the next *meme*, *fad* whatever, but this won’t be
the happy byproduct or unintended consequence of an event, but the
**sole purpose of this blog posting**.

Yes, I know, I can’t be so pretentious to think that I can start a craze
by just saying I’m doing so. But hey! I’m buzzed, I can do what I want!
I can try to do all sort of impossible things. Requiring success is not
on my radar. In fact, I’ll be right back in a few minutes while I find
an elegant and simple solution to Fermat’s last theorem.

**Everyone out there get buzzed and blog I say!**

I’m back and man, I have written a fantastic solution in the margins of
this blog, but I accidentally deleted it and wiped my drive with DOD
level 7 erasing technology. Lots of 1s and 0s overwriting that bit of
mathematical legendom. It’s rather freeing to take away all inhibitions
and intelligence and just type words as they flow
`System.IO.StreamOfConsciousness`.

As I mentioned earlier, I have a friend visiting from London. Let’s call
him *Michael* (don’t let the fact that Michael is his real name bother
you. We needn’t quibble over details).

In any case, since I have a production move at 2:00 AM (I’m just here to
consult if things don’t go smoothly), I thought I might as well go out
for a drink with my friend beforehand. So after a few dead-ends (it is a
Monday evening after all), we end up at Temple bar where a very friendly
band named *[Boku](http://www.bokulive.com/)* (meaning plenty) is
playing.

I started the evening off with a Knob creek, moved to a whiskey sour,
and ended up helping Michael and his friend finish their whiskey sour
and mojito respectively. That leaves me quite loosened up for a 2AM
production move that is currently moving along quite smoothly. We’re
just waiting for the scripts to finish.

**Yes, I do realize that any present and future employers will now
consider me a loose cannon and will not want me near their production
databases**. But as I said, I’m only here on a consultory and
supervisory role. I have no real access right now and am not a danger to
our business (whew!). Besides, I’ve done production moves for a Fortune
100 client after several fine margaritas from El Cholo back when I
worked at a Microsoft Gold Partner. I wouldn’t recommend that as a
standard practice, but all went well. Till next time, over and out...
