readers are asked to supply alternate meanings for various words (&
leave it to the Post to search for new meanings).

       answer the door in your nightgown.

      you are run over by a steamroller

​11. Testicle (n.), a humorous question on an exam.

​12. Rectitude (n.), the formal, dignified demeanor assumed by a\
       proctologist immediately before he examines you.

       Yiddish expressions.

       goes up on the roof and gets stuck there.
