[points](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/10/14#When:9:37:44AM) to a
[blog posting](http://www.geekfun.com/archives/000409.html) by Erik
Speckman calling Google Desktop Search a disappointment. One complaint
that Dave
[shares](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/10/14#When:11:55:02AM) is
that Google search only works with certain file formats. He wants to be
able to add plug-ins for file formats it doesn't already understand.

Well first of all, this is a BETA technology. I think it's a tad bit
premature to call it a disappointment just yet. It's already far better
than any other free desktop search utility out there.

Secondly, it may well be as extensible as Dave and Erik would like, but
as a BETA product, we can't be sure yet because such interfaces are not
published. Scott Hanselman started [digging into
it](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=86b31198-7002-416d-a68c-3330ebc0c189)
a bit and noticed various dlls used to implement searching across IE and
Outlook. That suggests that there might be a plug-in architecture they
will expose later (perhaps after getting feedback during the BETA
trial). In any case, Scott's peek inside is a worthwhile read.

UPDATE: Erik [notes in
reply](http://www.geekfun.com/archives/000410.html) on his blog that I
have a valid point regarding Google Desktop's BETA status, but that the
point of a BETA is to gather criticism. I agree wholeheartedly and I
think he gives some solid suggestions to the Google team. The title of
his reply is "Google Desktop Search **BETA** is a disappointment"
(*emphasis mine*). That clears it up for me. :)

If you're a Windows, Office, and Outlook user like me, I think you'll
find the BETA worthwhile. If not, Google has some work to do to make
sure the final product isn't a disappointment for users like Erik and
Dave. Hopefully we'll see an extensibility framework come out for it.
