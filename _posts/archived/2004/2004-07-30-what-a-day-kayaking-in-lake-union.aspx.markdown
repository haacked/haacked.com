There ought to be a law that requires employers to give their charges
the day off due to great weather. Back in Alaska, we'd have the day off
when it dropped to -60 F with snow up to your nostrils. They call it a
"snow day". Well there ought to be a "good weather day".

Not that I needed it, I'm on vacation fool! No, I ask for this for all
you suckers trudging to work while I was kayaking away on Lake Union in
Seattle. We paddled our way through a channel to Lake Washington and had
fun limboing underneath the freeway. Yes, underneath. There's a portion
of the freeway directly over the lake, and portions of it are only three
feet above the water. My wife and I nearly scraped our noses trying to
glide underneath laying on our backs against the kayak.

Earlier today we cashed in my REI dividend buying my wife some nice
sandals. Seattle has the nicest REI store I've ever seen, complete with
a huge climbing wall. It made me nostalgic for the wilderness of Alaska.
I had the sudden urge to climb mountains, wrestle bears and sleep in
caves. Then again, L.A. has its own version of wilderness that's pretty
wild too.
