Thanks to the help of the very talented [Joel
Bernarte](http://jbernarte.com/), I have a nice new look to the site. He
created the logo you see at top. I then spent a bunch of time trying to
modify the layout and Css to do the logo justice.

If you're viewing this in an aggregator, you'll actually have to take a
second outside of the aggregator to look at my site
[haacked.com](https://haacked.com/) using that antiquated piece of
technology that used to rule your life called a Web Browser (which might
just be integrated in your aggregator). Thanks. Now back to the new
technology that's ruling your life...
