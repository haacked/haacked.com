> Casio's Exilim cameras are the best digital cameras I've ever used,
> period. Great form-factor, great size, great -- fantastic -- UI, and
> great-looking piccies. Now Casio has announced a new whisker-thin
> credit-card-sized three megapixel Exilim with an optical zoom built
> in. I'm using the non-zooming 3MP and I've nearly beaten it to death
> (the Exilim is the first camera I've used that's small enough for me
> to carry 24/7): now I know what my next camera will be.
