Classic!

> Dear President Bush, Thank you for doing so much to educate people
> regarding God's law. I have learned a great deal from you and try to
> share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries
> to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them
> that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of
> debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other
> elements of God's Laws and how to follow them:
>
> ​1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and
> female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend
> of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not to Canadians.
> Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?
>
> ​2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in
> Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair
> price for her?
>
> ​3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in
> her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is,
> how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.
>
> ​4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates
> a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors.
> They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?
>
> ​5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus
> 35:2 clearly states that he should be put to death. Am I morally
> obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?
>
> ​6. A friend of mine feels that, even though eating shellfish is an
> abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than
> homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there "degrees"
> of abomination?
>
> ​7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I
> have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading
> glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room
> here?
>
> ​8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair
> around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.
> 19:27. How should they die?
>
> ​9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes
> me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?
>
> ​10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two
> different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing
> garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester
> blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really
> necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town
> together to stone them (Lev. 24:10-16)? Couldn't we just burn them to
> death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep
> with their in-laws (Lev. 20:14)?
>
> I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy
> considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can
> help.
