(Hey, everyone! It's the "Omer Asks For A Feature" time again!) reminds
me that I have a feature request as well regarding references in Visual
Studio .NET. I'd like to be able to reference an exe assembly. The
C-Sharp compiler supports it, but VS.NET strangely does not.

The main reason I want this is it will help me keep my unit tests
separate from the exe I'm testing as I talk about in this [earlier
post](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/04/28/374.aspx).
