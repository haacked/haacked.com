One day at kindergarten a teacher said to the class of 5-year- olds,
I'll give $2 to the child who can tell me who was the most famous man
who ever lived."

An Irish boy put his hand up and said, "It was St. Patrick." The teacher
said, "Sorry Sean, that's not correct."

Then a Scottish boy put his hand up and said, "It was St. Andrew." The
teacher replied, "I'm sorry, Hamish, that's not right either."

Finally, a Jewish boy raised his hand and said, "It was Jesus Christ."
The teacher said, "That's absolutely right, Marvin, come up here and
I'll give you the $2."

As the teacher was giving Marvin his money, she said, "You know Marvin,
since you're Jewish; I was very surprised you said Jesus Christ."

Marvin replied, "Yeah. In my heart I knew it was Moses, but business is
business..."
