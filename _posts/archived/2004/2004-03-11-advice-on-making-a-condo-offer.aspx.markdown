At least this advice worked for us.

In this housing market, it may help to write a personal letter with the
offer. Adds a personal touch to the potential 40+ offers the owner might
receive. My wife included a picture too. That might of been a bad idea
because the picture included me. But since it also included my wife, so
we'll call that a wash.

If you're ugly, forego the picture.
