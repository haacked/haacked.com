![](/images/Guinness.jpg)I tried a new drink this weekend. It's called
an Irish Car Bomb. It's a half glass of Guiness with a shot of Baileys
and Irish Whiskey in a shot glass on the side. You take the shot glass,
drop it in the Guinness, and then quickly down the whole concoction
before it coagulates.

It almost has slight chocolatey taste and is very creamy and smooth. It
was a nice alcoholic explosion before seeing Margaret Cho in concert.
