I doubt [these guys](http://www.wintellect.com/) went out of business,
but they're site has been unavailable since last evening. Perhaps
someone bumped into the power switch?

UPDATE: Niels reports it is back up and indeed it is. Justin Pitts
mentioned it was up for him which indicates it was a routing issue. I
performed a Tracert and found that it died when it reached Alter.net. I
was just making sure it wasn't a bigger outage over here.
