![Snowboarding](/assets/images/snowboarding.jpg) A group of us went
snowboarding at Mammoth mountain this past weekend to celebrate Judy's
(Dan's wife) birthday. I won't be so uncouth to tell you how old she
turned. We stayed in a nice little condo with the 7 of us.

On the slopes for the first day, the weather was brilliant! It was very
bright, sunny and hot, probably around 65 degrees or so. Hot enough for
girls in bikini tops to snowboard around, while I was stupid enough to
be wearing a long sleeve shirt and my jacket, completely burning up.

This was a good trip for me as I improved alot. After tackling a few
blue-black diamond (advanced-intermediate) slopes, I was cocky enough to
tell my wife that I'll soon be as good as she is. So she promptly took
me up to the summit so we could try the Cornice Bowl, a black diamond.

At the top, a friendly sign forewarned "Black Diamond runs are for
EXPERTS only". At the lip of the bowl, I looked down, and I mean
STRAIGHT DOWN, and felt a rising wave of unadulterated, first time
watching Nightmare on Elm Street, fear. Needless to say, my wife
smoothly made her turns down the slope while I can't really do justice
to what I did. I started off toe-side, trying to plow my way down a bit.
Perfecting my deer-in-headlights impression, I was paralyzed for a
moment. Standing nearly straight up on my toe-side, yet able to reach
straight out and touch the slope (I ride goofy foot), I realized this
was steep.

I was not willing to point my board down the slope in order to make a
turn. After snowplowing down a bit, I gained some courage and tried a
turn, only to be rewarded with a mouth full of snow and a Pete Rose
slide for 30 yards. I think I have a long ways before I can mouth off to
my wife about how I'm approaching her ability. :)
