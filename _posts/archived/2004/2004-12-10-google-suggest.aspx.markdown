Not to just join the chorus, but I am blown away by [Google
Suggest](http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en). It's a simple
idea, but well executed - it guesses what you are searching for as you
type it and presents the options as a list. If you've used the
auto-complete feature in IE, you'll get the picture.

Suuure... This is what you were \*really\* searching for.

So in the above screenshot, I've typed in "good clean f" and Google has
presented it's best guess in the text box as well as other options
below.
