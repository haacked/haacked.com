![Tab](/assets/images/Tab.jpg)I chuckled to myself when I read this ["public
service message brought to you by the Terminally Picky Developers
Association for Readable
Code"](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/12/08/3775.aspx)
on [Craig Andera's blog](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/).

I admit it, I'm guilty of using Tabs, but I have (at least in my mind) a
good reason. Besides the fact that the code looks fine to me, I like
navigating my code using the arrow keys. With tabs, when your cursor is
at the beginning of the line and you hit the right arrow key, the cursor
jumps to each tab position. If you convert tabs to spaces, you have to
hit the arrow key two to four times (depending on your setting) for each
tab. Unlike the "most discerning developers", my tabs are set to 4
spaces so that wolud be quite annoying.

However, if a coworker was to raise a big fuss (or if I ever work with
Craig), I'll consider changing my evil ways.

And to my non-tech friends, yes, programmers are this anal.

UPDATE: Aaron Robinson notes in my comments that I could navigate with
CTRL and the arrow keys. A good suggestion, and I often do that, but it
requires two keys at a time instead of one. Also, in the case of moving
text back, if I want to move a line back a tab, I like that I can just
hit the backspace key rather than SHIFT+TAB. Once again, it's one key
verse two. When typing is painful, I like to reduce the number of
keystrokes as much as possible. But maybe I'm just being lazy.
