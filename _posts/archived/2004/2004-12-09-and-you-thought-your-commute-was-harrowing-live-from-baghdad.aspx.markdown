My neighbor Chris blogs about the harrowing
"[commute](http://serjak.blogspot.com/2004/12/commute.html)" from the
Baghdad airport to the Green Zone.

> In just a few minutes, we clear the gate and our driver floors the

> bumper, with local Iraqi traffic parting like the Red Sea before us.
> You can see that the locals are used to these mini-tanks and dive to

> shock and horror, I see cars driving the wrong way on a 4-lane
> expressway and coming straight towards us. The PSDs don't seem to
> panic and, as I learn later, flow of traffic and lane right-of-ways do
> not really translate in this country. Apparently, it's quite common to
