First Kyle, then Micah. I've bugged him, cajoled him, annoyed him, till
finally he caved and installed RSS Bandit. Took about five minutes
before he became a full fledged addict. I have a feeling he'll be up
really late tonight. Next step is to get him set up with a [.TEXT
blog](http://dottextwiki.scottwater.com/). I'm so eeeeevil.
