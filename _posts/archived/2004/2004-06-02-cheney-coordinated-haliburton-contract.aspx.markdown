> Apparently, Time has obtained [an internal pentagon
> email](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040607-644111,00.html)that
> links Dick Cheney directly to the no-bid contract that Haliburton
> received for rebuilding Iraq's oil infrastructure. Sadly, people most
> likely won't hear about this, and it will die with all the other
> smoking guns that practically scream out and demand some independent
> investigation into this administration. Clinton got one for getting a
> hummer from an intern, but the current administration, flagrantly
> flaunting its corruption, slips by over and over again. [via the
