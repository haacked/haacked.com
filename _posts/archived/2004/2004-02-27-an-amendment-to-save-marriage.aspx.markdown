Bush believes that an amendment is necessary to bring “clarity” to the
issue of gay marriage and to preserve the social fabric of our great
nation.

Praise Be The Lord! Well Ok Bush, I’m with you. But before we work on
that amendment, there’s another Amendment we need to pass first. The
Amendment to remove the scourge of Divorce from our country. It is
necessary to preserve the social fabric. For it sayeth in the Gospel of
Mathew chapter 19 verse 9 (King James Version):

> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be
> for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
> whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.

For your homework, also look up Deut 22:19, Matt 5:32, 19:9, Mark
10:9-12, Luke 16:18, Rom 7:2, 1 Cor 7:10-11, 7:39.
