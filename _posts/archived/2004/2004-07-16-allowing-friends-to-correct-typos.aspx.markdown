I like this idea found on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/):

> Whole Lotta Nothing has sent out a lazyweb request for a blogging
> plug-in that would allow a blogger's close friends to correct typos in

This would be great for friends of mine like
[Koba](http://koba.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/) who has a horrible
spelling problem. ;) I'm constantly sending him emails of his typoz.
Then again, I'd love to let him correct my typos, like the one at the
end of the previous sentence.
