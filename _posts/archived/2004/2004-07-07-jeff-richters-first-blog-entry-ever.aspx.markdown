![Applied .NET Framework Programming](/assets/images/AppliedFramework.jpg)The
blog you've all been waiting for, Jeff Richter is keeping a blog. Well
actually, it's a
**[Wintellog](http://wintellect.com/WEBLOGS/wintellect/)**!. Several
members of the Wintellect team have formed a group blog. It seems Jeff
Prosise is holding down the fort as the most prolific blogger of the
bunch.

I first met Richter (not that he'd remember me) in September of 2000 (or
something like that) around the time when .NET was entering the beta
phase. I attended a four day class in Redmond taught by him, with Dr.
GUI in attendance. I also met John Robbins as he came out to dinner and
a movie with the group. We went to see Charlie's Angels.

I can summarize Richter's teaching style in one phrase, "Ok, we'll just
bust out ILDASM and take a look at...". Seemed like we were looking at
ILDASM every five minutes, getting a sense of what was happening under
the hood. It was great, though
[Reflector](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/) has taken ILDASM's
place in my tool of choice.

In any case, Richter's book, [Applied Microsoft .NET Framework
Programming](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735614229/102-3951359-6195345?v=glance)
remains my favorite .NET book to date. Glad to see you in the
blogosphere.
