Be aware that there is a PayPal scam going around. I received the
following email which had a forged from address of
"DoNotReply@PayPal.com". There's a reason they don't want you to reply,
because it exposes the scam. They'd rather have you run the attached
program. **DO NOT DO IT!** This is a scam. It is easy to forge the
headers of an email. It didn't come from PayPal.
