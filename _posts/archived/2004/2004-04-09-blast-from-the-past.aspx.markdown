I was recently contacted by a Contractor that I worked with a loooong
time ago, Hi Thomas! Funny thing is, he contacted me because he was
trying to find information about Reporting Services. My [former
employer](http://www.solien.com/) is all over the place when you search
on those two terms.

Funny thing is that he works for CyberU now, a company we did some work
for years and years ago. I was surprised to hear that they are still
around and have a tech staff of 12 developers. I have to give credit to
their president for changing directions and making something of the
company.
