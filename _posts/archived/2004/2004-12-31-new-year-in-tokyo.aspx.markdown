After a wonderful time with my family in Anchorage, we flew back to Los
Angeles for a day, dropped Twiggy off at a doggy day care, and flew into
Tokyo. Below is a picture of Anchorage from our airplane as we were
leaving.

The transition from 2004 to 2005 was quite uneventful this year. I think
I was asleep when we crossed the international date line. Unfortunately
we didn't have a countdown or bubbly. Well there's always next year. New
Years Eve is a special day for my wife and I as that is the day we met
in 2001/2002.

In any case, to my pleasant surprise, my mother-in-law's building has
been outfitted with wi-fi internet access! I was expecting a severe case
of internet withdrawal, but my RSS Bandit installation is humming along
nicely and I'm able to post a blog post or two while here.

But even nicer was the exquisite meal that awaited us when we arrived.
Here's a pic of a small plate of sashimi we had. Along with the sashimi
we had some onigiri and tempura. Akumi's mom is a phenomenal cook.

Well I better be off to bed and let the fight with jet lag begin. I wish
you all a happy new year and hope we all can make some exciting things
happen in 2005.
