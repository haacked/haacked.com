Today was my first day bringing the Tablet PC to work and I immediately
put it to good use. I think that the paper pad metaphor that One Note
uses may be implemented too well.

I was diagramming our existing site functionality and flow and had to
erase some mistakes I made. So I took the stylus and rubbed the back of
it on the screen to erase some of my scribblings.I then proceeded to
take the side of my hand and brush the screen off.

Realizing what I had done, I started laughing out loud. It just occurred
to me that I was instinctively going through the motion of wiping away
the bits of eraser chunks that would normally be on a pad of paper after
such intense erasing. The sort of chunks that aren't created when you're
dealing with digital ink.

I better be careful before I start applying white-out to the screen.
