A little while ago I said we've decided to [adopt a
doggy](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/31/1062.aspx). Well we did it.
On Saturday we got a call that an Italian Greyhound was in need of a
home immediately. So we drove out to Visalia (about three hours north of
L.A. a little past Bakersfield) and picked her up.

Her name is Twiggy (after the 60s fashion icon) and I'll post some
photos later. Needless to say, we're very tired as she is not yet house
trained and seems to have lost her natural instinct NOT to soil her den.
