![Soccer Ball](/assets/images/SoccerBallBW.jpg) Americans often have a low view
of soccer players (though that is changing in recent years). They don't
think of the sport as physical as football or even basketball. However
from my experience, soccer players are every bit as tough as their
counterparts in other sports.

Case in point, for the past two weekends in L.A. it's been rainy and
cold (don't laugh, cold for L.A.). Both weekends we had games scheduled
on the most perfect pitch and a full squad showed up. However, there
have been several times that we couldn't get a full squad for my morning
basketball game at the Y because it was raining, and we're playing
indoors!

![Rain](/assets/images/rain.jpg) Back to the subject at hand, there's nothing
like playing a solid game of soccer (or Football for my European readers
or futbol for my spanish speaking readers) with rain pouring down. The
artifical turf (the kind with the rubber pellets) actually grips the
ball pretty well compared to grass which sends the ball skidding like a
runaway luge team. The only difficulty is that the ball itself gets a
bit slick, creating many opportunities for "whiffing".

On rainy days, it's helpful to have hair. For instance, I sent a perfect
cross to the center and my teammate planted his forehead firmly on the
ball, only to have the ball slide off and away. He's completely bald.

Unfortunately we lost due to an own goal on a corner kick which made the
score 2 - 1. I hyper-extended my arm at the elbow, so I'm in a bit of
pain today, but I think it'll heal up nicely.
