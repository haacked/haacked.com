Time to get political. I loved how Kerry caught Bush off-guard when he
pointed out that in 2002, Bush [said he wasn't concerned with
Osama](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/latimests/bushnotconcernedaboutbinladenin02).
Realize this is at the same time our troops were in Afghanistan looking
for the bastard. I think that beats the out of context "nuisance" quote
by a mile, because even in context, Bush's quote is damning.
