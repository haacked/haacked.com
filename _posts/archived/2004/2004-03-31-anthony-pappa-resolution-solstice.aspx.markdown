![](/assets/images/AnthonyPappaResolution.jpg)I've been on a real Anthony Pappa
kick lately. Right now I'm listening to Resolution CD 2 Track 12,
"Solstice" at home and am blown away at how rich and full it sounds on
my piddly Altec Lansing computer speakers. I spend way too much
listening to my music turned down real low at work that I don't
appreciate how good this stuff can sound in the a half way decent
environment.

Of course, I'd love to hear this in a PROPER environment. I need to look
into getting a real sound system. My father-in-law is a Sony
manager/engineer in Japan who is really into his sound equipment. He
custom built his current speakers and they deliver a very smooth crisp
sound. Hopefully I'll be able to enlist his help one day in building a
hi-fidelity system. He's turned me onto Bossa Nova and Samba music.
