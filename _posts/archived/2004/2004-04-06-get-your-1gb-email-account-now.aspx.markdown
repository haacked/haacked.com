![](/assets/images/spymaclogo.gif)Looks like a another company has stolen some
of the thunder from Google's announcement offering 1GB of email. Spymac
announces in this
[post](http://www.spymac.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=70497) that
they offer 1GB of email storage with a promise that there will be no
adwords or other forms of promotion linked to email content.
