We're all moved in to our new place. I took a personal day Monday so
that we could put the place together and not have to live in a huge
mess. Much love to Dan, Micah, and Matt for helping with the heavy
lifting.

The tough thing right now is that we don't have an internet connection
yet, though it's been ordered. I'm looking forward to the 3Mbs cable
connection from Comcast. In the meanwhile, I was hoping to piggyback
onto a wireless connection. Not surprisingly these days, there are two
wireless networks in the vicinity. Unfortunately, one is protected by a
WEP key, so I'll leave that one alone (though I hear WEP is easy to
break). The other is unprotected, but it is up very sporadically. This
will be a loooong wait...
