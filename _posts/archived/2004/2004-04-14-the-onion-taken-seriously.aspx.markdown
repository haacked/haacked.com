![](/assets/images/theonion.jpg)I'm not one to act like an elitist snob and
make fun of stupid people. Ok, who am I kidding. I do like to make fun
of stupid people. Especially those with no sense of humor. Wired News
has this [great
article](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,63048,00.html "Wired News Article On The Onion")
about how many people take [The
Onion](http://www.theonion.com/ "The Onion") as serious news.

For those of you who have never read [The
Onion](http://www.theonion.com/ "The Onion"), it is a satire site with
deadpan news articles that are quite humorous. Apparently however, the
satire is lost on people. For example, there's the Chinese reporter, a
paragon of journalistic integrity, who plagiarized a news article on the
Onion. Then there's the many groups who held prayer vigils after reading
an Onion story concerning a Chinese woman who gave birth to septuplets
and has one week to choose one to keep and throw the rest off a mountan
top.
