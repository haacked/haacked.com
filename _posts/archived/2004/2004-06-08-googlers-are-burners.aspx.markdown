![Google Logo with Burning
Man](http://www.google.com/logos/googleburn.jpg)

Sergey and Larry have moved up a couple of notches of coolness in my
book. They're burners! They attended Burning Man in the summer of 1999.
The logo above is what they put on the Google site while they were out
of town. In commemoration of the upcoming Burning Man, I'll put up some
picks later from 2002 when we went.
