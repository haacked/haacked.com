Recently my company (which was a division of Company X) was purchased by
Company Y. Company Y is based outside of the country and we are a fully
owned subsidiary and make up their U.S. presence.

A couple weeks ago or so we found out that my boss (our CTO) was
promoted to CTO of the parent company. He has to spend 25% of his time
at the parent company's headquarters in Canada and 75% here, though it's
been more like 50/50. Some of my coworkers are starting to call me
"See-Toe". (Get it?).

In any case, I'm currently the lead on integration efforts to get our
platform running on cell phones and set-top boxes. It's one of the more
interesting projects I've worked on, though I really can't (or am not
sure if I should) talk about it much here.
