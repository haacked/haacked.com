![Rooster](/assets/images/rooster.jpg)This farmer has about 500 hens, but no
rooster, and he wants chicks. So, he goes down the road to the next
farmer and asks if he has a rooster that he would sell. The other farmer
says, "Yep, I've got this great rooster, named Kenny. He'll service
every chicken you got, no problem."

Well, Kenny the rooster costs \$3,000, a lot of money, but the farmer
decides he'd be worth it. So, he buys Kenny. The farmer takes Kenny home
and sets him down in the barnyard, but first he gave the rooster a pep
talk. "I want you to pace yourself now. You've got a lot of chickens to
service here, and you cost me a lot of money. Consequently, I'll need
you to do a good job.! So, take your time and have some fun," the farmer
said, with a chuckle.!

Kenny seems to understand, so the farmer points toward the hen house and
Kenny takes off like a shot. WHAM! Kenny nails every hen in the hen
house - three or four times, and the farmer is really shocked.

After that, the farmer hears a commotion in the duck pen and, sure
enough, Kenny is in there. Later, the farmer sees Kenny after a flock of
geese down by the lake. Once again - WHAM! He gets all the geese. By
sunset he sees Kenny out in the fields chasing quail and pheasants.

The farmer is distraught and worried that his expensive rooster won't
even last 24 hours. Sure enough, the farmer goes to bed and wakes up the
next morning to find Kenny on his back out in the middle of the yard,
mouth open, tongue hanging out and both feet sticking straight up in the
air. Buzzards are circling overhead.

The farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colorful and expensive
animal, shakes his head and says, "Oh, Kenny, I told you to pace
yourself. I tried to get you to slow down, now look what you've done to
yourself."

Kenny opens one eye, nods toward the buzzards circling in the sky and
says, "Shhhh .. they're getting closer."
