![](/assets/images/dellultrasharp.jpg)If you haven't tried it yet, you should
really give [Froogle](http://froogle.com/) a look. I'm currently looking
to buy an LCD monitor and I checked the usual suspects,
[Pcworld](http://www.pcworld.com) and
[Tomshardware](http:/www.tomshardware.com) for reviews,
[Pricegrabber](http://www.pricegrabber.com/) for prices, but due to lack
of inertia, I never thought to try Froogle.

Searching Froogle, I found a Dell Ultrasharp 17" ([highest rated by
PCWorld](http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,114600,00.asp))
for $399.00 with free shipping. At that price, I think I'll get two. I
was intending to get a 19", but since 17" give you the same resolution
as a 19" and are much cheaper, I think two 17" beat one 19" in terms of
value and productivity.

I'm also in the market for an ergonomic chair, but that could take a lot
of research.
