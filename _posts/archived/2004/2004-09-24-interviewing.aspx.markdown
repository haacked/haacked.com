I’m conducting some phone interviews today for a C++ contractor/employee. Man it’s been a long time since I’ve conducted
interviews. I wish I kept a list of my favorite questions to ask.

Maybe I’ll start off with:

-   What is your age?
-   What is your sexual orientation?
-   What is your race?
-   Who are you going to vote for?
-   Are you married or pregnant?
-   What’s your religion?
-   How fat are you?
-   Would you be willing to line my pocket for this job?

Oh wait. Those are the questions that are ILLEGAL to ask. Doh!

Perhaps I should just re-read [The Guerilla Guide to Interviewing](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000073.html).
