![Vacation](/assets/images/Vacation.jpg)I'm taking all of next week off of
work. Wohoo! Well actually, I'm only on vacation from my day job. Monday
and Tuesday I'll be working on some contracts I've got going on the
side. Then on Wednesday, the little lady and I are [heading out to
Seattle](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/06/29/707.aspx) to visit her
best friend. Hopefully I'll have some time to work on RSS Bandit too.

Tonight I'll be going out for a few drinks with my buddy Micah. He quit
his job and went independent. He's poised to take over the world soon,
while I'm jockeying to position myself to ride his coattails. ;) He's
got a lot of great ideas on how to make IT a value proposition and not a
cost.

Saturday night, I have a big soccer game. Sunday I have an acupuncture
appointment and we're going to the [Hollywood
Bowl](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/07/23/838.aspx) concert. Whew!
We're pretty busy this weekend.
