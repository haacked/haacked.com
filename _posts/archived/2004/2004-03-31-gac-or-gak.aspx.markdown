![GAK](/assets/images/Gak.jpg)Every time someone tells me to register a
component in the GAC, I think of GAK. Do you remember GAK? It was this
*Are you sure an alien didn’t sneeze this up?* brightly colored gooey
junk made by Nickelodeon. You can still [buy the
stuff](http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=200761430&loc=23014 "Buy the stuff")!.

But what’s better than buying stuff? Making it! I found this little
article online on [how to make
GAK](http://www.reachoutmichigan.org/funexperiments/agesubject/lessons/aboutlessons/polymers.html "how to make GAK").
Your assignment, make tons and tons of this stuff! It never lived up to
its potential to take over the world.
