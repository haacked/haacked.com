![Snowboarding](/assets/images/Snowboarding.JPG)Yesterday Akumi, Laura, Judy,
and I drove to Mountain High (not a reference to smoking out) for a day
of snowboarding. This would be my second time snowboarding since the big
Conversion from skiing. Right now, I would rate myself as an
intermediate snowboarder and advanced intermediate skiier.

Mountain High is only a two hour drive away from Los Angeles, which
makes it ideal for a day trip. The only problem is that it’s only two
hours away, meaning anybody and everybody shows up. To start the day, we
took a lift up the beginner hill to get warmed up, and the hill looked
like the aftermath of a battle scene from Lord Of The Rings. I’m talking
Pellenor fields here, with bodies strewn all over the place. The
beginners hill is in reality an obstacle course that would test even
Hillary Lindh (Alaskan reference).

In any case, we had a great day of boarding. Akumi and I even tried a
few jumps, though she fared much better than I did. When approaching the
jumps, I need to learn to stay on my front edge. Rather than a "Need For
Speed", I have an intense "Fear Of Speed" when on a snowboard
approaching a ramp. I’ll start my approach, gain some speed, and as I
get close, start riding on my back edge where I feel very stable on the
approach, but very unstable on the landing.

I welcome any snowboarding tips in my comments section.
