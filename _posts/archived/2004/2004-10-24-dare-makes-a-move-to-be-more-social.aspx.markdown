[Dare Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/), the project lead on
the [RSS Bandit project](http://www.rssbandit.org/) (of which I
contribute) is leaving his post as a Program Manager on the XML team at
Microsoft to work as a Program Manager on the MSN Communication Services
Platform team.

When Microsoft revealed a [blogging service](http://spaces.msn.com/)
similar to Blogger, I had a feeling it was only a matter of time before
Dare would somehow be involved with that seeing his interest in [Social
Software](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=06ff2206-27a3-4d55-81d8-bbee37073d6d).

It will be interesting to see the direction Microsoft takes with social
software. Although Microsoft perhaps doesn't see entering the aggregator
market as a profit center, I wouldn't be surprised if that changes in
the next year or so.

As aggregation continues to take off, it seems natural to incorporate it
into Office. Remember that "Information At Your Fingertips" mantra Mr.
Gates touted a while ago? Well I get most of my online information
through two sources, Google and RSS Bandit.

In any case, I wish Dare well. Hopefully this is the platform for him to
have some of his ideas implemented. I have to admit, I'd love to work on
social software such as RSS Bandit and .TEXT full time. But I have a
mortgage to pay.
