With the news that we are about to be home owners, Kyle’s comment was

Akumi and I have both agreed we would’t start the baby making aparatus
until we have a place. Now that we have a place, we’re not ready to
start that cycle just yet. She just recently found her calling and is
interested in getting that career off the block.

Pattern Making. Everybody in the L.A. fashion world wants to be a
clothing designer. It's the hip thing to do.

Many designers don’t know squat about actually putting clothes together.
Every one of them needs pattern makers to take their designs and put
them onto paper. Really, it’s just like the being an architect for the
fashion world. The designer is really more like a GUI designer, asking
for this and that. The pattern maker takes that information and creates
a pattern which is analagous to a software specification. That
specification can then be used to actually make the clothes in question.
Apparently Pattern Makers are in hot demand here.
