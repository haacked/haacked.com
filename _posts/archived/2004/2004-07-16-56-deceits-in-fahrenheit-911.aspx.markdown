Earlier I posted the [factual
backup](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/07/12/806.aspx) from [Michael
Moore's website](http://www.michaelmoore.com/) concerning Fahrenheit
9/11.

In an effort to be balanced, I present here a list of [56 deceits in
Fahrenheit
9/11](http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htm)
from a person who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. I mention that to point
out that this is not a list from a rabid Republican. It's a bit long,
but a worthwhile read to gain some perspective on the movie.

So when are we going to get a documentary that provides a more balanced
view of what went down?

Thanks to [Adam Kinney](http://www.adamkinney.com/) for sending me this.
