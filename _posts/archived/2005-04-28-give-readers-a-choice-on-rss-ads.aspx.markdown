Well I didn't get much of an on topic response [to my
question](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/04/26/2839.aspx) of whether
readers would be bothered by ads in an RSS feed, but I did get into a
nice chat about hosting at home verse with a service. Apparently [Robb
Allen](http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/) has enough computers at
home to supply a third-world country. Think about it Robb? They can
really use it. ;)

But it appears that a [general
backlash](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/04/28#a487) is
brewing against the idea. It's the battle between the Utopian view of
RSS and market pressures. Personally, if a feed is interesting enough to
me, I'd be happy to tolerate ads as long as the ads weren't too
distracting or garish. For small fries like me, it's a nice way to
supplement the income, especially as one who has recently made the jump
to be independent.

Having said that, it's almost always a bad move to alienate readers
(unless your taking a principled stance on an important issue you
believe in). The best choice (for me at least) is to offer a choice
(paper or plastic?). I'll probably keep my main feed ad free, but add a
separate (but equal) rss feed that would contain an occasional ad. At
that point I'll cajole, grovel, and beg subscribers to switch to the
feed with ads to help a brotha out.
