It’s that time of year again when the sakura (cherry blossoms) bloom and
allergies kick into high gear. When the drive home is no longer shrouded
in darkness and when the ASP.NET team releases Software!

today we released the RTM of ASP.NET MVC 2 for Visual Studio 2008 SP1.
See [Scott Guthrie’s announcement about
it](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/03/11/asp-net-mvc-2-released.aspx "Announcing ASP.NET MVC 2").

My team and I are excited about this release as it adds a lot of great
new functionality for those building web applications with ASP.NET MVC.
As with ASP.NET MVC 1.0, the community (yes, that’s you people!) were
heavily involved in the making of this product via multiple preview
releases. So thank you!

### What about Visual Studio 2010?

Keep in mind that this release includes project templates for Visual
Studio 2008. Visual Studio 2010 RTM will be released fairly soon and
that will contain project templates and runtime for ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM in
the box.

If you have Visual Studio 2010 RC installed, you’ll find that the
installer for ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM is blocked just as it was for ASP.NET
MVC 2 RC 2.

To remedy the situation, you just need to uninstall the ASP.NET MVC 2
runtime first, and then run the ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM installer.

I’ve outlined the steps in more detail in a previous blog post
describing [how to install MVC 2 RC 2 on a machine with Visual Studio
2010
RC](https://haacked.com/archive/2010/02/10/installing-asp-net-mvc-2-rc-2-on-visual-studio.aspx "Installing ASP.NET MVC 2 RC 2 on a VS2010 RC").
These same steps apply, but switch “RC 2” with “RTM” of course. :)

Again, sorry for the inconvenience. Once Visual Studio 2010 RTM ships,
this will all just work.

### Source Code! Source Code! Source Code!

As always, the source code, along with our Futures library, is
[available on
CodePlex](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/releases/view/41742 "ASP.NET MVC 2 RTW on CodePlex").
For those looking for the Ms-PL package, we will be releasing the source
code for `System.Web.Mvc.dll` very soon.

### What’s Next?

I’m glad you asked. While we’ve been very busy getting this release
ready, preparing for Mix 10, closing down on ASP.NET 4 and Visual Studio
2010, we’ve still found time to start preliminary planning for ASP.NET
MVC 3.

It’s very early and nothing is written in stone yet (*of course not,
it’d be written in C#*), but you can [read our rough
roadmap](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Road%20Map&referringTitle=MVC "ASP.NET MVC 3 Roadmap")
that outlines some of the ideas we have for the next version.
