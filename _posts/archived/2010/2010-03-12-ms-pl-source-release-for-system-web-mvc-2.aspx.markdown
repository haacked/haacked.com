Hot on the heels of the [release of ASP.NET MVC 2
yesterday](https://haacked.com/archive/2010/03/11/aspnet-mvc2-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 Released!"),
I’m happy to announce that we are **releasing the source code to ASP.NET
MVC 2 under the**[**Ms-PL
license**](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-pl.html "Ms-PL License text"),
an OSI approved Open Source license.

This continues the trend from nearly a year ago when we released ASP.NET
MVC 1.0 under the Ms-PL. You can [read my blog post
there](https://haacked.com/archive/2009/04/01/aspnetmvc-open-source.aspx "Open Source License for System.Web.Mvc")
to learn more about the hard work that goes into such releases.

While I’m one who loves lawyer jokes, I do appreciate the work that they
do (one of my best friends is a lawyer) and am grateful for the hard
work our legal team put in to make this happen again.

### Get the source!

To grab the source code, visit the **[ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM Download Details
page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=157074 "ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM Download Details Page")**
and look for the file named ***mvc2-ms-pl.zip***.

### What’s next?

This time around, we’re not planning to stop with just the source code
for `System.Web.Mvc.dll`. There’s a bit more source I would like to
release under the Ms-PL which should hopefully be coming soon if I can
get the ducks to line in a row (*who knew releasing code required
working with ducks?!*).
