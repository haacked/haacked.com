The ASP.NET Team is still looking for that QA person out there who
shares our passion for technology and improving the means by which
software is made.

Keep in mind that the QA position on our team is not someone who
mindlessly follows a script hoping by sheer random luck to find bugs. Oh
no no no my friends.

This is considered a software development position in which you will be
responsible for improving the processes and tools we have in place for
ensuring quality software. You’d be involved in improving the quality of
*all phases* of product development as a valued member of a feature
crew. Think broadly about the idea of software quality. Your role is to
question whether we’re building the *right* product as much as it is to
test the product once it is built.

[Matt Osborn](http://blog.osbornm.com/ "Matt Osborn"), a member of the
ASP.NET MVC feature crew [has a description of the
position](http://blog.osbornm.com/archive/2009/12/01/we-want-you-again-if-yoursquore-a-test-ninja.aspx "We want you (again) if you're a test ninja").

Keep in mind we’re not looking for “test” ninjas as in “sample” ninjas.
We’re looking for the *real deal*, brimming with throwing stars of bug
finding. Ok, the analogy breaks down a bit there. But you get the
picture.
