UPDATE: We moved the date to February 24th.

The stars at night, are big and bright – clap clap clap clap – **deep in
the heart of Texas**!

Hold onto your ten gallon hats, I’m visiting Texas for the first time!
I’m very excited to visit the *second* largest state in the union. ;)

The purpose of my trip is to meet with some developers at Dell doing
interesting things and to give a talk there as well.

But since I’ve heard such good things about the vibrant tech community
in Austin, I am trying to make the most of my short trip. **On
Wednesday, February 24, I’ll be speaking at [Austin .NET User
Group](http://adnug.org/ "Austin .NET User Group Website") meeting at
7:00 PM CST**at the [Microsoft offices in
Austin](http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/usaoffices/southcentral/austin.mspx "Microsoft Office in Austin")**.**So
be sure to come by and say hello.

We moved it to the 24th so if you were planning on attending [Martin
Fowler’s talk on February
25th](http://connect.thoughtworks.com/TechnologyForumAustin/ "Technology Forum Austin"),
you can see both! Unfortunately for me, I was hoping to see Martin
speak, but I saw that they’ve closed registration.

I’m also going to visit my good friends at
[Headspring](http://www.headspringsystems.com/ "Headspring") as well as
[Dovetail
Software](http://www.dovetailsoftware.com/ "Dovetail Software") to
jabber about technology and see what cool things they’re doing with
ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC.

And of course, a trip to Austin wouldn’t be complete without a night out
on the town with
[Bellware](http://blog.scottbellware.com/ "Scott Bellware"). I expect
chaos. ;)
