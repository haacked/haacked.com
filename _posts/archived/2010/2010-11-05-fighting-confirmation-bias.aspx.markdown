This month’s Scientific American has an interesting commentary by Scott Lilienfield entitled [Fudge
Factor](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fudge-factor "Fudge Factor") that discusses the fine line between academic misconduct and errors caused by confirmation bias.

For a great description of confirmation bias, read the [YouAreNotSoSmart.com’s post on the topic](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/23/confirmation-bias/ "You are not so smart - Confirmation Bias").

The fudge factor article talks about some of the circumstances that contribute to confirmation bias in the sciences.

Obviously this doesn’t just apply to scientists. I’m sure we all know developers who are equally prone to confirmation bias, present company
excluded of course. ![Winking smile](https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/Fighting-Confirmation-Bias_12B38/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png)
Pretty much everybody is succeptbile. We all probably witnessed an impressive (in magnitude) display of confirmation bias in the recent elections.

However, there’s another contributing factor that the article doesn’t touch upon that I think is worth calling out, our education system. I
remember when I was in high school and college, I had a lot of “lab” classes for the various sciences. We’d conduct experiments, take
measurements, and plot the measurements on a graph. However, we already knew what the results were *supposed* to look like. So if a measurement
was way off the expected graph, there was a tendency to retake the measurement.

“Whoops, I must’ve nudged the apparatus when I took that measurement, let’s try it again.”

As the article points out (emphasis mine)…

So how can schools do a better job of teaching scientific methods? I think one interesting thing a teacher can do is have students conduct an
experiment where the students *think* they know what the expected results should be beforehand, but where the actual results will not match up.

I think this would be interesting as an experiment in its own right. I’d be curious to see how many students turn in results which match their
expectations rather than what matched their actual observations. That could provide a powerful teaching opportunity about scientific methods
and confirmation bias.
