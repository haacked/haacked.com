Along with [James Senior](http://jamessenior.com/ "James Senior"), I’ll
be speaking at a couple of **free** [Web
Camps](http://www.webcamps.ms "Web Camps") events in South America in
March 2011.

For a list of all upcoming Web Camps events, see the [events
list](http://webcamps.ms/upcoming-web-camps.aspx "Web camps events").

If you’re not familiar with Web Camps, the website provides the
following description, emphasis mine:

> Microsoft's 2 day Web Camps are events that allow you to learn and
> build websites using **ASP.NET MVC**, WebMatrix, OData and more.
> Register today at a location near you! These events will cover all 3
> topics and will have presentations on day 1 with hands on development
> on day 2. They will be available at 7 countries worldwide with dates
> and locations confirming soon.

Did I mention that these events are free? The description neglects to
mention [NuGet](http://nuget.codeplex.com/ "NuGet Package Manager"), but
you can bet I’ll talk about that as well.

I’m really excited to visit South America (this will be my first time)
and I hope that schedules align in a way that I can catch a
Fútbol/Futebol game or two. I also need to brush up on my Spanish for
Argentina and learn a bit of Portugese for Brazil.

One interesting thing I’m learning is that visiting Brazil requires a
Visa (Argentina does not) which is a heavyweight process. According to
the instructions I received, it takes a **minimum of 40 business days**
to receive the Visa! Wow. I’m sure the
[churrascaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churrascaria "Churrascaria")
will be worth it though.

Good thing I’m getting started on this early. Hey Brazil, I promise not
to trash your country. So feel free to make my application go through
more quickly.
