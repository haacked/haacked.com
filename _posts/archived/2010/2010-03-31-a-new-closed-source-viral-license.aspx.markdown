The “copyleft” provisions of the GPL ([GNU General Public
License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL "GPL on Wikipedia")) require
that any changes or additions to a GPL licensed work must itself be
licensed under terms that adhere to the GPL.

Critics of these “copyleft” provisions have derogatively labeled the GPL
as a “viral” license. Such criticism points out that any code that seeks
to incorporate GPL licensed code must itself adhere to the terms of the
GPL, thus potentially “infecting” other code with its restrictions.

This has caused many developers of proprietary systems to be concerned
about any usage of GPL code within their products for fear of turning
their closed source codebase into a GPL licensed open source codebase.

But now there’s a new viral license to be feared. This new license us
the product of a legal thought experiment that was assumed to be purely
theoretical in nature, but impossible to actually realize. The
experiment proposed the following question:

**Just as there is a license which virally turns closed source code into
open source code, is it possible to craft a viral license that does the
opposite, turning open source into closed source?**

Jim, I’m afraid it is.

The possibility of this specter has been a grave concern for many open
source experts for years, but now has been realized by the new
antithesis to the GPL called the CSPL, which stands for **Closed Source
Proprietary License**.

Under the terms of the CSPL (pronounced Sess-Puhl), any codebase
operating within the same user memory space of the CSPL licensed code is
itself licensed under the CSPL which removes all rights to view or
change the source code.

Famed Linux developer [Linus
Torvald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds "Linus Torvalds"),
when presented with this news, could only muster the following comment.

> Are you fucking kidding me?!

Which coincidentally was the same response uttered by notable Ruby on
Rails creator [David Heinemeier
Hansson](http://www.loudthinking.com/ "DHH's blog") (aka DHH), apart
from the fact that DHH omitted the words “Are”, “you”, “ing”, “kidding”,
and “me”.

Noted open source developer [Miguel De
Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel's Blog") railed against this
library in his twitter feed 140 characters at a time noting:

> The CSPL is a travesty and a cancer and it must be stopped. OTOH, as
> long as [http://trollcats.com/](http://trollcats.com/) is unaffected
> it can't all be bad. BRB...

Miguel could not be reached for further comment as he was ostensibly
engaged in finding the proper TrollCats image to express his complete
outrage.

TekPub co-owner [Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob's blog")
glumly noted that sales of his developer focused educational videos have
declined precipitously ever since he was forced to redact the source
code from his screen casts.

Well regarded speaker and .NET luminary [Scott
Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman's blog") had this
to say…

> This reminds me of the panic that ensued when it was discovered that
> [the last GUID had been used
> up](http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/archive/2010/04/01/last-guid-used-up-new-scottguid-unique-id-to-replace-it.aspx "Last GUID used up").
> By the way, have you seen the [Hamster on a
> Piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDyS2AMjius&feature=player_embedded "Hamster on a Piano at YouTube")?

Prolific blogger and open source developer, [Oren
Eini](http://ayende.com/Blog/default.aspx "Ayende's Blog") (also known
as Ayende) noted with dismay that he was finding it very difficult to
continue working on his projects formerly known as open source while
averting his eyes from the screen in order to comply with the license.
His blogging and open source contributions took a noticeable hit as he
only managed 256 blog posts in the past week while contributing 297,051
lines of new code to NHibernate, Rhino Mocks, and Log4Net.

Richard Stallman could not be reached for comment on this matter, but it
can be safely assumed a legal challenge is brewing.
