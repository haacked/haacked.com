Our eye in the sky reports two angry evil (but devishly good looking)
cyborg units, XSP 2000 and TRS-80, are fast approaching Black Rock City.
They are considered very armed and dangerous. In fact, they are mostly
armed and not much else.

These cyborgs do **not** come in peace. I repeat, they are to be
considerd hostiles. However, we’ve received a secret communiqué that
reveals a weakness built into these cyborg models. Due to a lack of TDD
during development, a bug in their FOF system (friend or foe) causes
them to view anyone offering a frosty beverage to be a friend, not foe.

Any attempts to engage with these hostiles will result in calamity
unless you offer them an ice cold beverage. For the sake of your beloved
city, I suggest stocking up.

Intelligence confirms they are headed towards their evil cyborg camp at
**8:15 and Kyoto** on the Playa and are predicted to arrive on Tuesday
morning. If we band together, we may be able to save our fair city by,
once again, offering *frosty alcoholic beverages* in order to confuse
their FOF system.

You’ve been duly warned.

This blog (and associated Twitter account) will go quiet for at least a
week as communication systems are nonexistent within the Black Rock City
area.
