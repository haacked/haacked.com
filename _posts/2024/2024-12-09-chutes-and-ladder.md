There’s a comforting fiction we’re sold: the career ladder. You know the one—a pristine vertical climb of increasingly impressive titles, ending in the golden glow of a C-suite. It’s simple: start as Junior Whatever, move to Senior Whatever, then Lead So-and-So, Director This, VP That, and maybe one day, CEO.

If you’re lucky, you might climb the ladder as an Individual Contributor (IC). Often, though, the next rung means trading your hoodie for a baby-blue power shirt and sliding into management.

Sometimes my career followed this script. My first job saw me rise from developer to team lead to Senior Manager. I was hustling up that ladder.

But life, unlike the metaphor, isn’t linear. Real careers are more like the game Chutes and Ladders: lucky breaks vault you upward, but unexpected turns send you sliding down. And in real life, those chutes aren’t failures—they’re opportunities.

Take my own journey. From Senior Manager at my first job, I stepped back to IC at my second. My next two roles blended coding and management. At Microsoft, I became a Senior Program Manager, switching from managing people to managing programs. Then, I took a “chute” to GitHub, starting as a developer, becoming a manager, and ending as Director of Engineering. After that, I co-founded a startup, donned the title of CTO, but mostly wrote code. It looked like a ladder step up, but in the startup world, titles are often just window dressing. And that startup failed.

The Problem With Ladders

Ladders are narrow and rigid, leaving little room for exploration. Titles—while shiny—can obscure what really matters: the work itself. They’re bumper stickers for your career—good for signaling, but not the full story.

As a Director, I mentored teams and influenced initiatives at scale. But I missed being close to the technology. Managing five teams meant juggling tech stacks—some familiar, others new. The longer I stayed away from hands-on coding, the more disconnected I felt. When I became a CTO, I got back to coding and loved it. But when the startup failed, I promised myself a year off to reflect.

Sliding Into Growth

Now, over a year later, I’ve been contemplating my next move. Conventional wisdom (and my ego) says I should aim for a bigger title—maybe VP of Software Development. But bigger roles come with bigger stress, and life circumstances make that incompatible with the balance I need.

Here’s what I realized: I’ve had a successful career. I have nothing left to prove. I don’t need a lofty title to feel accomplished. What I want is to get back to what I love: writing code and building things.

So, starting January 6th, I’m taking on a new IC role. I’ll share more soon, but I’m excited to be in the trenches again, learning and building.

This isn’t about rejecting leadership; it’s about recalibrating. Leadership comes in many forms—guiding organizations or leading by example, building great things and inspiring others. And I believe it’s healthy to move between the front lines and the back office.

Reframing Success

Success isn’t a straight climb. Sometimes it’s shipping a small feature that delights a handful of users. Sometimes it’s mastering a new skill, even without a title bump. And sometimes it’s realizing the ladder you’re climbing leans against the wrong wall.

Viewing careers through the lens of Chutes and Ladders changes the game. A chute isn’t a setback—it’s a redirection. It’s a chance to reassess and explore paths you might have missed while fixated on climbing.

Your Move

If you’re staring down a chute, wondering if stepping off the ladder will derail your progress, consider this: maybe the chute isn’t a setback. Maybe it’s an express route to something better—something that aligns with who you are and what you want.

Careers aren’t about perfectly stacked titles. They’re about collecting experiences, relationships, and skills that shape you into a better version of yourself. Sometimes, the most important moves don’t look like progress—until you find yourself somewhere unexpected, doing work that truly matters.

Spin the dial. Take the slide. Because even in Chutes and Ladders, the winner isn’t the one who climbs highest—it’s the one who enjoys the game.
