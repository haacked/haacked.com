The career ladder is a comforting fiction we're sold as we start our career. Start as Junior, climb to Senior, then Principal, Director, VP, and finally one day gain access to the executive bathroom and bask in the C-suite glow.

If you’re lucky, you're at a place that supports staying in an Individual Contributor (IC) as you climb the ladder. But often, the next rung swaps your hoodie for a power shirt, suspenders, and management duties.

My first job followed this script: developer to team lead to Senior Manager. I was hustling up that ladder.

But life isn’t linear. Careers are more like Chutes and Ladders. Lucky breaks shoot you up; surprises send you sliding down. Those chutes? Not failures. Opportunities.

Take my journey. I stepped down from Senior Manager to IC at my second job. Two roles later, I was blending coding and management. At Microsoft, I changed roles as an IC Senior Program Manager. Then came a chute: GitHub. I started as a developer, became a manager, then Director of Engineering. After that, I co-founded a startup, took the CTO title, but spent most of my time writing code. It looked like the standard progression up a career lader, but in startups, titles are smoke and mirrors. So it only would have counted as a step up if we had succeeded. [Sadly, we failed](https://haacked.com/archive/2023/11/13/failure/).

## Ladders Are Overrated

Ladders are narrow and rigid. Titles—while shiny—hide what matters: the work. They’re bumper stickers for your career. Nice to signal, useful to get that next job, but incomplete.

As Director, I mentored teams and scaled initiatives. But over time, I started to miss the tech. Five teams meant juggling stacks—some familiar, some new. The longer I stayed out of writing production code, the more disconnected I felt. As a CTO, I got back to coding and loved it. When the startup failed, I promised myself a year break, at least, before jumping into something new.

## Growth on the Slide

Over a year later, I’ve been thinking about my next move. Conventional wisdom (and ego) says aim higher: perhaps VP of Software Development or CTO at an established company. But big titles means more demands and less control of my time. Life circumstances make it so that control over my time is very important to me. Big titles might mean more pay, but maximizing pay isn’t my goal.

Here’s what I realized: By my own definition, I’ve succeeded. I've been a part of great teams. I've been a part of building great products and companies. I have nothing to prove to anyone. I don’t need a lofty title. I don't need to maximize my paycheck.

So once again, I'm setting aside my pride and stepping off the ladder. On January 6th, I start a new IC role. Details to come, but I’m thrilled to be back in the trenches, building and learning. It's a place that treats its employees like adults and will provide me the autonomy to structure my day as I see fit.

This isn’t about rejecting leadership. It’s recalibrating. Leadership is broad. It’s guiding organizations or leading by example. I believe it's healthy, and even advantageous, to move back and forth between IC and management. As life changes, I may return to management. Or not. The point is to stay open to what’s right for me now.

## Your Move

If you’re staring at a chute, wondering if stepping off the ladder will ruin you, consider this: maybe it’s not a setback. Maybe it’s a shortcut to what you really want.

Careers aren’t about perfect titles. They’re about collecting experiences, relationships, and skills that shape you. Sometimes, the most important moves don’t look like progress—until you’re somewhere unexpected, doing work that matters.

Spin the dial. Take the slide. Even in Chutes and Ladders, the winner isn’t who climbs highest. It’s who enjoys the game.
