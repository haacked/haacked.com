Seems like everyone and their mother has an opinion on the “right” way
to have comment threads. Currently
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext project website") supports
the same model as .TEXT did, a simple linear sequential list of
comments. It is simple and gets the job done.

The 37Signals blog addresses the [question of
comments](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/dealing_with_comment_threads_at_blogs.php "Comment Threads")
and presents several examples of how different sites handle it.

Personally I like the first example. It retains the simplicity and
fluidity of the linear approach, while adding a bit of useful meta-data.
What do you think?
