Proving the whole 6 degrees of separation thing, I finally received an
invitation to Orkut. The thing that struck me was when highlighting a
button I noticed this in the status bar:

javascript:\_\_doPostBack('btnUpload','');

Ah, now doesn't that look familiar. I looked up and noticed I was on the
http://www.orkut.com/SignUpPhoto.aspx page. Definitery an ASP.NET page.
Cool.
