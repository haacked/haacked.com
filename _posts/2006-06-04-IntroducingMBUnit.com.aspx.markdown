If you’ve read my blog for any length of time, you know that I am a fan
of the [MbUnit](http://mbunit.com/ "MbUnit") generative unit test
framework.

What I haven’t been a fan of is linking to the MbUnit website. If you
want to refer someone to NUnit, you simply link to
[http://nunit.com/](http://nunit.com/ "NUnit"). But if you want to refer
someone to MbUnit, you have to type out this monstrosity:
[http://www.mertner.com/confluence/display/MbUnit/Home](http://www.mertner.com/confluence/display/MbUnit/Home "MbUnit home").

So in addition to complaining about it, I decided to do something about
it. I purchased MbUnit.com and pointed it to their website. Now when I
mention MbUnit in a post, I can spare my fingers a few keystrokes.

One other issue I hope this helps solve is that the MbUnit website comes
up second in Google search results. First is its old hosting location.
Hopefully everyone will start updating their links to point to
MbUnit.com instead and help solve that issue.
