message: "Written April 28th 2022.\r\n\r\nYou don't make investments you create what you want to invest in. CREATE the actual company/companies. Create the actual stock! If you know the name of the company and have a means of understanding how to run it and don't want to just invest but actually have your name associated with the accounts. If you travel back to the 50's you have a chance to create ALL the companies you desire. You can create Amazon, Apple&Apple Music, Iphones, you can even control the music industry and the real estate industry. You can BE THE STOCK MARKET. Knowing what bands/musicians are going to  become popular is only a small piece of the pie. You can manage big band names and get money also that way by knowing ahead of time where they are going to be you can get into the stock market and run EVERYTHING. NOT just real estate BIG corporations, Big Pharma EVERYTHING you have a chance to control and run and be apart of every business decision that was ever made prior to the 50's. That is scary the amount of power you can actual obtain. The mega millions lottery numbers are available online every year. I would recommend hitting big and starting your own music company and then from there start another company in real estate and another and don't make investments but control the investments themselves.\r\n\r\nhttps://pulseblueprint.com/lifestyle/learning/biggest-companies-in-the-world-50-years-ago-and-today/\r\n\r\nFind me I was born 1992 St. Jude Fullerton CA Crystallynn Leeann Byrne to a Linda Inez Byrne.
