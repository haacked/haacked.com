  Feels like it might be useful to optionally `cp` or `ln -s` files from your current working directory to the new checkout? As command-line arguments, perhaps?



  I know you mention that as being beyond the scope of this tool but imo it'd let you boil the whole "checkout PR and keep moving" into a single command that you have documented for each project, e.g.



  tree-me pr 123 --cp .env --ln vendor
