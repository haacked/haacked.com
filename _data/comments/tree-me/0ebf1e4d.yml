  I’ve done similar but mines integrated with a whole suite of get wrappers. I also don’t choose the worktree directory. It is a formula



  ~/gits/remote-server/org/repo/wt/branch_name



  So to create a work tree for branch fix-bug-342 for repo foo/bar hosted at github:



  -

  ~/gits/github/foo/bar/wt/fix-bug-342



  Because everything‘s under one tree, I can then build an index that gets maintained. I don’t have a command called git-go that will present me with a menu of all the workspaces that I can then pick and cd to. I can also put a partial filter in there and reduce the size of the menu.



  If anyone’s interested, it’s all on GitHub matthewpersico/personal
