  I wish there was a good solution for this. It should "explode" (throw) if I try to access a collection that I haven't included (when not lazy loading). This is a case where a runtime exception would actually be an improvement over the default. Just silently giving an empty collection is really frustrating and I can't seem to find a good alternative.
