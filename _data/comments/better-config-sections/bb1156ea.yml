  “Interesting topic! Custom config sections and the use of static virtual members in interfaces can certainly add flexibility and structure to code. I’m curious about how this approach compares to other methods in terms of maintainability and performance. Are there any specific challenges or best practices you’ve encountered when implementing this technique? Thanks for sharing your insights on this advanced topic!”
