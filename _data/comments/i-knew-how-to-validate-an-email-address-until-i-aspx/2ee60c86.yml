  I believe that there are individuals who have lost their crypto one way or the other. I strongly advise that you don't seek help recovering it online because you are likely going to meet a scammer who will steal more of your funds in an attempt to help you recover your lost crypto. I personally have used recoveryhacker101 when I had to recover my bitcoin stolen by scammers. You can contact this legit recovery firm by email (recoveryhacker101@gmailcom).
